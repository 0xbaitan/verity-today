                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Not even a year after her album Lover, Taylor Swift took to Instagram to announce the
release of her eighth studio album, folklore, in less than 24 hours. Although at the first listen
the project may seem jarringly different from all her other works, the album is in fact a
culmination of the best features of all her past releases, with Swift highlighting what she has
always done best: her songwriting. </p>

		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "articles/Folkoreimage2.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Sonically having nothing in common with the pulsating bass-lines of reputation and 1989,
folklore comfortably places itself amidst mostly acoustic instrumentals of piano riffs and the
twangs of guitar strings, harkening back to Swift&#39;s debut in the country scene, and
accompanied by the likes of soaring string quartets, a brass section, and even a complete
pipe organ. The black and white aesthetic of the album art depicting her in the forest (she
doesn&#39;t seem to have made it out of the woods after all) along with the soft lowercase of the
titles of all the tracks contribute to the style of the music itself: the chart-topping songstress is
no longer concerned about the commercial success of her music, but instead views it as
cathartic art for the sake of art, with folklore displaying a muted maturity and sobriety that
was hinted at only in her documentary Miss Americana, but has been conspicuously missing
in most of her past albums. However, make no mistake of it: although the entire album was
written in the space of merely 3 months, it remains Swift&#39;s richest work thematically, focusing
on her writing abilities rather than over-the-top production and radio hits.</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Personally, what I find most interesting about folklore is the intersection of its themes with
that of reputation, with both albums essentially being two sides of the same coin. Veterans of
the fanbase need no introduction to the dark and moody tones of the latter: with the media
embarking on a witch-hunt against Swift in light of her feud with Kanye West and her
apparent serial-dater status, she vanished for two years in response to the manipulation,
gossip and vilification she was subjected to in 2016. With her 2017 release, reputation, Swift
combats the image of her created by the paparazzi and her rivals, and presents her identity
for what it truly is, reclaiming her reputation for herself. </p>
		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">folklore follows the same principle of playing with the power of stories and legends, although
subverting it to apply to both biographical elements of her life as well as tales of fiction. This
time, it is she who is in control of her narrative from the get-go, mocking the media by
making it nearly impossible to ascertain which songs are about her own life, and which are
figments of her imagination. In the foreword to her album, she writes:</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">â€œA tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes
even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between
truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths,
ghost stories, and fables. Fairy tales and parables. Gossip and legend.&quot;</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Time and again, Swift has stressed on the storytelling aspect of the album, and a closer look
at some of the songs are sure to display her confessional and self-referential style.
Overarching motifs are present throughout the project, linking songs together- the best
example of this would be what Swift herself refers to as the &quot;Teenage Love Triangle&quot;
consisting of the three songs cardigan, august, and betty. The trilogy narrates the drama of a
high school relationship between two teenagers, James and Betty, and the strife that occurs

between them when James cheats on the latter with another girl, Inez. Lyrics in all three
songs displaying recurring phrases and themes bind them into a fascinating display of
writing skill and creativity. Interestingly enough, the two characters James and Inez are
named after the two daughters of her close friends Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, hinting
at the fact that it might be a sapphic love story, especially since James&#39; gender is never
explicitly mentioned.</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">In epiphany, a haunting track with ethereal harmonies, Taylor connects the past world to the
modern civilization by pointing out the constant turmoil that is ever-present. Making
references to both her grandfather fighting in the Second World War as well as the ongoing
coronavirus pandemic she pleads for &quot;just one simple glimpse of relief&quot;. Further historical
references are made in the last great american dynasty, one of my personal favourites. The
song talks of Rebekah Harkness, a dancer and philanthropist married to an oil trader,
making her one of the richest women in America at the time. The Rhode Island home Swift
currently resides in was formerly owned by Harkness, and in narrating the dancer&#39;s story,
she makes subtle connections to her own situations. Harkness was considered to be the
&quot;maddest woman&quot; the neighbourhood had ever seen, with Taylor describing her as a &quot;misfit
widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that had cast her out&quot;. She flies in her &quot;Bitch Pack
friends from the city&quot; to the chagrin of her neighbours, a cheeky reference to Taylor&#39;s own
2015 squad of models and pop stars, for which she came under fire for propagating elitism
and exclusionist ideals. In the final stanza, she compares herself to Harkness, boldly
declaring how she &quot;had a marvellous time ruining everything&quot; after purchasing the same
home the philanthropist had wreaked havoc in. The connections between Rebekah and
Taylor are strengthened later on in mad woman, a reference to the town&#39;s denunciation of
Harkness. The song follows a similar style to The Lucky One from her album Red, which
talks of an unnamed celebrity being driven mad by the fame and the spotlight, and how Swift
considered herself to be on a similar path.</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Taylor&#39;s creativity reaches its apotheosis in Track 5 of folklore, my tears ricochet. Track 5&#39;s
of each of her albums are notorious among the fandom for usually being the most vulnerable
and emotional songs in the album, and this one is no different. The ghostly overture is
bitterly narrated by a dead woman, whose ex-lover decides to intrude at her funeral.
However, fiction and reality begin to blur again as the writer makes further connections to
her own life: the song is largely considered by critics and fans alike to be a metaphor for her
ongoing battle with her old label, Big Machine Records, who bought the masters to her first
six albums, leaving her with absolutely no ownership of her own music. With subtle nods to
her songs being referred to as &quot;stolen lullabies&quot;, and the record label &quot;tossing out the blame&quot;
and &quot;saving face&quot;, Swift presents an impassioned plea in the form of a haunting tune,
characterised by spectral choirs and fading instrumentals.
While many of the songs are sombre in nature, invisible string is a light-hearted, plucky
attempt at wit and humour, being the most self-referential of all the songs in the album.
Alluding to her long-time boyfriend Joe Alwyn&#39;s past part-time job in a yoghurt shop, her
comfortable friendliness with her exes, and even laughing at a British waitress asking her if
she was &quot;some American singer&quot;, the song is a comfortable reminder that Taylor really is
doing better than she ever was, in spite of the melancholy mood of the album. Other notable
tracks include exile, a collaboration with Bon Iver, comparing a harsh heartbreak to being
banished from one&#39;s country:</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">&quot;You&#39;re not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?

You were my town, now I&#39;m in exile, seein&#39; you out.&quot;</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">seven presents a child&#39;s innocent take on domestic abuse going on in her friend&#39;s
household, with possible subtext suggesting the turmoil arose due to the child&#39;s hidden

sexuality. With peace, Swift takes on a Joni Mitchell-esque persona to croon about themes
similar to that in Dancing With Our Hands Tied of reputation, about finding love in spite of
hardships and disturbance all around them.</p>

		<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">While her closing tracks are usually hopeful and looking out for new beginnings, hoax
presents a curveball to this expectation. Instrumentalised by nothing more than a bleak
piano riff and Taylor&#39;s desolate vocals singing of someone&#39;s love being &quot;the only hoax [she]
believes in&quot;, the track is probably the most despondent of the 16 songs released. However,
all is not lost: in the very final chorus, the song modulates from a minor to a major key,
injecting some sense of bittersweet hope in the barren landscape initially presented.
With the timeless and ethereal spirit of the album, folklore has cemented itself as the
strongest creation put forward by Swift. The writer&#39;&#39;s storytelling powers have never been
stronger, and just like the legends, lore, and myths that she sings about, folklore is bound to
find itself as one of the best concept albums in recent times, a perfect retort to all those who
claimed she was incapable of writing anything other than &quot;thoughtless, mind-numbing,
mainstream pop&quot;. Regardless of her chart domination and radio success, one thing is
certain: spanning eight albums, three genres, and boasting of global recognition, Taylor Swift
can do it all, even if it&#39;s in the middle of an actual pandemic.</p>
