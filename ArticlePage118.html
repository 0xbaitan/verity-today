                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">As a Barca romantic, i don’t even know how to start this article. However, I will not be biased in
my novice analysis of the UCL quarter-final faceoff between FC Barcelona and Bayern
Munchen, because yes- the latter did beat Barcelona by a margin of 6 goals. And yes, the way
Barca were playing, they’re lucky they did not concede more even if it seemed impossible for
them to.<br><br>
From the very beginning of the game, you could see the Cules taking an aggressive, attacking
approach. The whistle blew, and the blaugrana shirts broke into Bayern’s half. What happened?
Bayern intercepted the ball. This pretty much sums up the whole game. Yes, there’s nothing
wrong with adopting an attacking strategy. Alas, there’s everything wrong with having no
structure in the team and playing half-planned passes to anyone who is visible in an attacking
position. Muller netted one for Bayern 4 minutes into the game. 4 minutes. Indeed Barca struck
back, with David Alaba scoring an own goal in a crazy mishap. Possibly Barca’s highlight of the
match. Messi was made to play on the right wing when the game started, with Suarez drifting in
from the left. That was considerably alright, with Barcelona exploiting the space left by the
relaxation of Bayern’s defensive line. Then everything went upside down.<br><br>
Messi was shifted to the center with the Catalonian team adopting a 4-4-2 formation. What
impact this significantly had is that the potential of Messi’s space-making was taken away, he
was now surrounded by Bayern’s defense and midfield. Bayern exploited this apparently small
change in a beastly manner, shutting down the only source of attack FC Barcelona planned to
work on, constructively disrupting their loosely-tied pattern of attack. This was not even the
worst part about the Blaugrana’s dim decision making throughout the game.<br><br>
The nightmare of a plan of play the manager adopted, (and i mean, NIGHTMARE) was the
horrible, horrible defensive trap the Cules tried to adopt.<br><br>

Take a look at this picture. This was most of the game. No, I don’t mean to say that Ter Stegen
had possession of the ball for most of the game. This picture is just a prelude to most of the
goals Bayern scored versus FC Barcelona. Bayern has thrashed 99% of the teams it has played
this season because of it’s clinical attack with it’s constant and efficient pressure as a
substantive. Don’t get me started on their link-up’s and communication. They’ve simply
mastered their game. What Barca slyly tried, in order to battle the Beastly Bavarians was this-
they invited Bayern’s attack into the final third. Now, this may sound like a genius move from the
mind of the new manager, but no- it was not. It was a very, very stupid one the non-sensible
simplicity of which overshadowed it’s object. How the Spanish team thought it would turn out
was that they would invite Bayern’s pressure, break through it, and score by Messi passing it to
Vidal, Suarez, Roberto, Griezmann, possibly even Dembele (wasn’t brought on) in the final
third. How it turned out was-<br><br>
a) They invited pressure from the Bavarians,<br>
b) The Bavarians scored.<br><br>
Whenever they did break, they tried it too fast and threw the chances away. This gave Bayern
the opportunities they just needed to see, and they grasped them with ease and composure.
Bayern moved forward in attack as a structured group of talented football players, with each
player occupying a potential hole in Barca’s defense. Yes, each attacker and midfielder
occupied a hole. Pique and Lenglet were looking like helpless teenagers against seasoned
professionals. It was horrible to watch. Barcelona, with an ignorant air, invited them and Bayern
accepted all invitations. This ignorance continued into the second half. Mueller had already
netted two in the first half, with Croatian left winger and pacey powerhouse Gnabry joining him.
Kimmich scored another in the 63rd minute with a beautiful run from Alphonso Davies from the
wing into the box who passed it to the 25 year old German right back, who further rounded off
the assist with a simple tap-in. Lewa got his goal in the 82nd minute, peculiarly scoring only one
throughout this siege of a match.<br><br>
Coutinho came on quite late in the match, and netted two, assisting one. This really topped
every joke that has originated from the game. The Brazilian, currently on loan from Barca, was
involved in as many goals in 15 minutes as he scored in 18 months for FC Barcelona. It was a
silent redemption, you could hear it in the goals. Still, the man refused to celebrate. Classic
humiliation. While former Bayern player, Arturo Vidal raged in the final minutes of Barca’s
humiliation, the Brazilian Coutinho almost remembered his once fantastic self.<br><br>

This game was constituted by two teams- both European giants, one at it’s best and the other at
it’s absolute worst. This, as Pique said, is rock bottom. FC Barcelona needs changes, and it
needs them fast. You can’t sustain your dominance in Spain, or Europe, if you play every match
with only one plan of defense and attack, varying throughout games, but staying the same when
losing horribly. This was the problem under Valverde, and this is the problem under Setien. Not
that he’s going to be around anymore. If Barcelona does not get a manager which understands
the team, it’s potential when structured well, and the fact that the team needs to know how to
change tactics within 90 minutes if plan A is not working, then FC Barcelona has indeed
reached the dark ages. Bayern, on the other hand, are at the very top of their game, and the
obvious favourites to lift the Champions League this season.</p>
