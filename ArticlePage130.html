The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a milestone in contemporary history (also diminishing the number of hours CIA operatives have to fill), but how was this huge union of communist States formed? And what role did Marx’s Manifesto play in it? 
To understand the role of the Communist Manifesto in overthrowing the Czar, we must explore the political ground the Manifesto aims to gain, and how this ground is what the Proletariat in Russia had always been deprived of by the Romanov dynasty.’

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> <b>THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE</b><br><br>
Marx believed every event in history to be either a consequence or cause of class struggles i.e strife or enmity between two classes of society. This is what the first line under the first chapter “Bourgeois and Proletarians” of the Manifesto essentially conveys- “The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.”
The social system in Russia was highly unequal. Serfdom had indeed been abolished in 1861, but there was a huge divide between the rich constituted by the clergy, nobility, aristocrats, and the poor workers/peasants. Czar Nicholas II of Russia, who ruled by the “Divine Right”, was an oppressive monarch, to say the least. The clergy, oh. The Tsar had introduced the “One Czar, One Church, One Russia.” concept at the zenith of his autocracy. Thus, the clergy had enormous amounts of influence over what was acceptable in Russia and what wasn’t. This was perfectly outlined by the existence and directions of Rasputin (yes, the one from “RA RA RASPUTIN, LOVER OF THE RUSSIAN QUEEN”) who technically controlled the country. He had considerable influence over the Tsarina, to whom the administration of the large country was left after the Tsar pronounced himself Commander-In-Chief of the army on the eastern front during the war and left the country. Rasputin was a drunkard and a womanizer, with illicit habits and brought instability to Russia using the Tsarina as an instrument who fired the competent ministers, appointed 4 incompetent Prime Ministers in the Ministerial Leapfrog. This symbolized everything that was wrong with the country. The social structure was highly identical to France’s feudal system before the French revolution, which indeed, gave way to liberal ideologies which were the first signs of the coming of liberal political and social systems around the globe.


                                       <br> <br><br><b>THE ECONOMIC CAUSES</b>
<br><br>
Now, Marx was indeed celebrated for going into the social implications of the division of labor and the procedure of production. It was this conceptualization of what work one does, or what part of a particular work one involves oneself in that defines what social class that person is inherently a constituent of. This was undoubtedly also the case in Russia. The proletariat had been formed on the basis of the grievances of the workers and peasants be it either- starvation, the backward economy, the overly oppressive polity, and the repression of inflow of liberal ideologies from Western Europe- a major one being, yes, socialism. 


<br><br>The industrial framework in Russia was far from developed, with there being around 500 factories, approximately. It was slow, stagnant, and disastrous. Moreover, the First World War had diminished imports because of the sudden tension between the nation-states across Europe, which led to a huge shortage of final products and their inputs. As we know, the considerably incompetent Nicholas II loved waging war and destroying his country’s moral simultaneously. Thereby, the underdeveloped Russia railway system instead of transporting food grains was wholly devoted to war efforts i.e transporting troops and weapons to the war front. Now, one may look to the agricultural sector in Russia and say that it could’ve sustained the economy. But what the Tsar so painstakingly did, is that he conscripted most of the peasants in the army, diminishing the manual labor devoted to agriculture to a huge extent. It is also to be noted that Russia was underdeveloped in most economic sectors, resulting in a lack of modern technology, which is why manual labor was the only input for agriculture.

<br><br>The point is, the Russian economy was messed up. And it heavily drew the pattern of society under the Czar, as predicted by our dear friend Marx. Thus, the proletariat was slowly formulated through these economic fallacies- both on the general scale and on the welfare scale which affected society and called for mass revolution. 

<br><br><br><b>THE ROLE OF THE MANIFESTO OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY</b><br><br>The problems above have been stated objectively, but I’m sure you cannot remember all of them. Yes, comrades, we come to a conclusion. The Communist Manifesto did not bring about the revolution, it simply awakened it. Facilitated it. It was the cherry on top, and all these major flaws which threatened the very existence of the Russian population was the cake beneath. There was no bread for the people. Half of the required food grains were imported into Russia, but more than 75% of the people starved. Revolution was inevitable. Lenin saw this and was bent on organizing it. This is where Marxism and Leninism clashed. Marx believed that the revolution would be something scattered, something unorganized but with a revolutionary force that would overthrow every economic or social norm which defined bourgeois society and assume the cloth of communism. 

<br><br>Another interesting thing to note would be that Marx saw the Communist revolution as something to overthrow bourgeois society, which had earlier overthrown the Imperialist society. However, in Russia, both the bourgeois and the proletariat revolution happened together. The Petrograd Soviet represented the latter whereas the Provisional Government represented the former. However, Lenin argued that Imperialism was indeed the zenith of the pure evil of Capitalism which is the basis of his book- “Imperialism, the Highest Stage Of Capitalism.”
Marx argued that industry and transport had to be developed to its zenith before the revolution. In Tsarist Russia, both were heavily underdeveloped. Many claim this is why USSR’s communism was a disaster. It was a frenzy revolution, neither absolutely aligned with Lenin’s thoughts nor with Marx’s. 

<br><br>One thing is for sure when the Communist Manifesto was popularized in the 1890s in Tsarist Russia, and the country’s workers and peasants took to reading it, the phrase “Workers Of The World Unite!” came into effect, and Marx had done his job. The Manifesto had a very transnational aspect to it, bringing every country’s proletariat into the frenzy. Though Russia was not heavily referred to in the Communist Manifesto, it joined the celebration the earliest, even though in a flawed manner. 
The Communist Manifesto is not a genius analysis of the capitalist economy. It is a concise statement of everything which was wrong with the bourgeois society, and it outlined what every common man in the world wanted. It was a simple, easily readable Manifesto, yet so powerful. And it gave birth to revolution for a century to come.
