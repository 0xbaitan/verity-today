                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The fifth edition of Bullionaire, the much-awaited Business Conclave of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, was held on the 21st and 22nd of August, 2020. Despite the virtual barrier, this fest proved to be a huge success, with seven riveting events.</p>
                                    
                                  <br><p>
                                  <center><img src = "articles/lsa1.jpeg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></center></p><br>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">'Dragon's Den’, as the name suggests, was an event filled with challenges and crises which students had to overcome while battling it to the top. This was a start-up event where students displayed their innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship and leadership skills while searching for and responding to problems present in the society.</p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The moot court event at Bullionaire, 'Judicature', was a very lively event where participants sophisticatedly and diplomatically presented the stance of their clients. The poise with which they answered the questions posed to them was remarkable and their research and understanding of legal principles brought up was impeccable.</p>
                                    
                                   <br><p>
                                  <center><img src = "articles/lsa2.jpeg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></center></p><br>    
                                   
		                           <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">'Kickbid' was the ultimate auction event at Bullionaire 2020. Teams battled their way through an intense bidding war and made an ideal football team using the budget that was given to them. In the first round, the participants were tested on their pressure management skills and knowledge about the game. Following the auction, they had a surprise simulation round for the participants. A custom tournament was created on FIFA 20 and livestreamed on YouTube, where participants could interact and express their views on the live chat. Both rounds were very dynamic and competitive, with participants displaying great management skills. </p>
                                   
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The World Trade Conclave was an event filled with surprises in each round. It was clear that the participants enjoyed it when they were in the waiting room at 3:47 even though the session was to start at 4. </p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">As the perfect end to an exciting first day they had an even more competitive surprise round – the online treasure hunt. The talented minds of participants made it one of the most unique auctions, with the bidding price of one of the items starting from Rs 1000 and ending at Rs 80. </p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The marketing event, 'Dynamo', was a thrilling one. Participants engaged in 3 different rounds. In the first round, they used their convincing skills to sell their product. In the second round, they came up with unconventional marketing methods which were less costly than traditional ones, keeping in mind the effect of covid on their revenue streams. The event ended with a round where participants took part in advertisement wars with each other on twitter and showcased their creative skills in the form of memes. The event as a whole gave participants an opportunity to understand various aspects of Marketing.<br>Bulls and Bourses was their stock exchange event. </p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">To make it even more challenging, for the first round, participants were given a client for whom they had to prepare a portfolio choosing stocks from the Nifty 50 index while meeting certain criteria set by the client.  </p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The second round was the mock trading round, where participants were given market updates followed by a trading window during which they could trade using the bulls and bourses website. The prices of the listed stocks were then be updated after the trading window closed. For the last two updates in this round, auctions were conducted for secret information. </p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The event concluded with the final round, which included government budget updates. Stocks were replaced by sectors and commodities in this round. This event gave the participants to gauge their critical thinking, time and money management skills and also their negotiation skills.</p>  
                                
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Lastly, their flagship event, Best Businessman, proved to be extremely competitive, with participants showcasing exceptional talent. The event was successful in creating an extremely interactive Boardroom Discussion, reminiscent of traditional offline ones with plenty of involvement from all 20 participants. The critical thinking skills of the participants, marketing strategies brought to the table and quality of pitching was commendable. All the rounds were quite dynamic, despite the virtual barrier. The participants displayed great all-round entrepreneurial skills and the event lived up to its name of ‘Best Businessman’.</p>
                                    
                                   <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The positive and encouraging words from students of other schools in the feedback round show that the event was pulled off perfectly. As a student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy I can personally attest that the positive feedback we received not only made our teachers proud, but also made sure that the efforts of the students who worked so hard to pull off this fest, were not in vain. The fifth edition of Bullionaire was truly a tremendous success.</p>
