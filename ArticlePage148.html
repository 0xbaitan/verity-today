                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">When's the last time you looked at a trend and wondered, What's the story behind that? You
don't have to be a fashion history major to know that some of the most popular styles of today
have a rich history and often have roots in different cultures. Take streetwear, for example, what
began as a style of dress adopted by minorities and hip-hop artists was eventually accepted and
					    co-opted by the world's top luxury brands, including Gucci and Louis Vuitton.<br><br></p>
		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "articles/titlein.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br><pclass="articleparagraph" style="color: white;" > <br><br>
When we think of South Asia in terms of fashion, we tend to associate it with the “Made in
Bangladesh” tags on our Zara t-shirts, exploitation and oppression, or a more traditional garb.
Contemporary South Asian designers are often forgotten or ignored because they are
incongruous with how fashion that hails from the Southern Hemisphere has come to be defined.<br><br>
When you think of Japanese fashion, you think of the kimono. But dig deeper and you’ll find that
Japan’s contribution to the world of fashion is much, much, more.<br><br>
Here’s a list which celebrates the origin and the historical importance of your favourite trends
today.<br><br>

OVERSIZED TREND<br>
Our go to for everything from denim jackets to distressed boyfriend jeans, oversized clothing
gained notoriety during the ‘80s hip-hop era. The lack of proper sizing was usually attributed to
the fact that clothes were often handed down from other family members of black communities
for hopes of saving money. At the time, hip-hop artists would perform in "regular street clothes"
in an effort to resonate with their fans. Eventually, the oversized trend reached other parts of
Hollywood and was soon welcomed by mainstream fashion.<br><br>

SNEAKER CULTURE<br>
Although sneakers have been around since the invention of rubber, the shoe didn't gain
widespread societal acceptance until the ‘70s but even then, athletic kicks were reserved for
sports and rarely had anything to do with fashion. Until the ‘80s, that is, when the decade's most
influential rap artists, like Run-DMC and Grandmaster Flash, established sneakers as a
wardrobe must-have. In a time when music and beat-boxing were shaping the culture, sneakers
became a symbol of identity, status, and belonging within Black communities. By the end of the
1990s this trend had global reach, with hardcore collectors in Britain, all across Europe and the
US, people arranged special outlets, swap parties, trainer events and gatherings in desperate

search for rare deadstock, vintage or limited edition collectable items — and the same continues
to be true today.</p>


		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">SCRIPTED NECKLACES<br>
Nameplate jewelry was the must-have item for Black girls everywhere LONG before Carrie
Bradshaw popularized her beloved monogram necklace that she referenced as “ghetto gold”
jewelry. But, we all know that “Ghetto is nothing but creativity that hasn’t been stolen, yet”, a
phrase coined by Ohio-based designer and philanthropist, Ron Blassingame.<br><br>

MONOGRAM PRINT, AKA LOGOMANIA<br>
It’s inevitable to discuss streetwear and logo mania without talking about one of the founding
fathers of streetwear, Dapper Dan. The American icon first began working out of his boutique in
Harlem, New York in the 1980’s. He began illegally screen printing popular logos such as Gucci,
Louis Vuitton and Fendi all over leather and using them in innovative ways that fashion houses
had not even yet thought of. His all-over logo mania designs weren’t limited to clothes but also
featured car interiors, curtains and furniture covers. Before he was shut down in 1989 by the
police, he was widely supported by the American rap and hip hop community, dressing names
like Jay Z, Floyd Mayweather, LL Cool J, P-Diddy among others. This then created a gap
between the supply and demand for the product which was later filled by commercial fashion
houses. Today logomania is another trend making its comeback on the runways of Gucci, Louis
Vuitton, Fendi, Dior among others.<br><br>

COSPLAY<br>
Combining the words “costume” and play”, this term was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi in
1984, and refers to the trend of wearing costumes of a particular character or theme, such as
Japanese anime. Over the last few years, cosplay has extended itself to outside the realm of
anime and manga characters and become commonplace, owing to events like FanimeCon and
ComicCon with themes from Hollywood movies and American pop culture.<br>

Many fashion houses, brands and celebrities seem only too happy to appropriate, whitewash
and profit off of different cultures without respectfully acknowledging their history, or striving to
diversify their company. You can't stop ignorant people from wearing kimonos flung loosely
around them as outerwear, but purporting the image of such is alienating and disrespectful to
the people whose culture they are taking from. Fashion and beauty still have a long way to go
with inclusivity, but a scenario where an Asian-"inspired" outfit is modeled by an Asian model
would arguably be one of the simpler and much appreciated ways to start</p>
