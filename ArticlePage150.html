                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Since rather a promising and bright Democratic National Convention is over, let us focus on
the other side, the Republican National Convention, held from 24 th to 27 th August. It frankly
seems that Mr. Trump and his party, in their campaign for votes and funds, attempted to
appeal to voters on an emotional level. While they also attacked Joe Biden, the Democrats’
presidential nominee, for only speaking and failing to deliver despite being in Washington
D.C for 47 years, no real promises were offered to the citizens by the Republicans to
strengthen their already weak case for reelection. The only thing they offered was their
slogans “Make America Great Again” and “America One”, and unabashed rhetoric.
On Day 1 of the Convention, Republicans like Nikki Haley, Vernon Jones, Kimberly Guilfoyle
and Republican Whip Steve Scalise went on an offensive against Biden and the Democrats,
condemning their ideas and also stating that they aim to establish a “socialist utopia”, which
will do nothing but stop US economic recovery and lead to misery of the citizens. Moreover,
the speakers also claimed that Democrats’ ideas would dismantle and destroy America’s law
enforcement, which is in response to the row between both the parties with regards to the
police reform bills.<br>
They also criticized him for including a tax break that would affect high earning taxpayers in
states like California and New York and said, “And now Joe Biden wants to come for your
pocketbooks. Unless of course you’re a blue state millionaire”. Apart from a speech by
Donald Trump Junior, the most notable speech was by Senator Tim Cook, where he
defended Donald Trump as one promoting the rights of the Black people, Hispanics and
other communities taking an example of his own personal life and in essence, using it to tug
on the emotions of the people. He took up the same topic to criticize Biden while
mentioning his bill, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, as one
which contributed to mass incarceration and put more black people behind bars. The
Republicans brought out the idea that the fight is for the “kind of country you want”.
The Day 2 of the Convention was marked by Mr. Trump using his presidential powers quite
directly to promote a political message to advance his and the Republican Party’s chances
for reelection. In pre-taped videos, the President issued a pardon for a man who had
robbed a bank in Nevada and later founded an organization for former inmates, and then
Trump presided over a naturalization ceremony for new American citizens. This comes in
the light of the fact that Trump has already been accused by the Democrats of violating
norms and traditions by utilizing the White House to make his speech on the last day of the
Convention.<br>
The First Lady, Melania Trump, came forward offering her support to her people who are
suffering during this pandemic and to the frontline workers, while being perhaps the first
one to make mention of the coronavirus pandemic at the Convention - especially
considering the fact that Trump has been downplaying the pandemic, its impact on the
nation and the importance of essentials like masks. Furthermore, the First Lady also stated
that her husband’s administration would not stop fighting until there is an effective
treatment or vaccine for the virus, which is available to everyone.</p>

		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "articles/11111.jpeg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Apart from Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump also speaking on Day 2, the inclusion of former
Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo throwing Foreign
policy into the mix - with the speakers trying to justify and defend Trump’s actions in the
international community. Bondi criticized Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and accused
them of nepotism in that Joe Biden was the man in charge of distributing US aid to Ukraine
while Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.
Mike Pompeo went on to praise Mr. Trump for being the one to actively work towards
peace in the Middle East by helping Israel and United Arab Emirates to sign an agreement to
normalize relations. He also praised Trump for being the one to bring the North Korean
leadership to the table, although no real results have been shown. But the fact remains that
from exiting the Paris Climate Agreement or the United Human Rights Council or the World
Health Assembly to practically isolating the country by portraying an “America First”
philosophy, and being the laughing stock of world leaders like Boris Johnson, Emmanuel
Macron and others, it can be rightfully questioned whether Trump’s foreign policy was
sound.<br>
Day 3 of the Convention was marked by Vice President Mike Pence formally accepting the
Vice-Presidential nomination for the 2020 election. In his speech from Fort McHenry in
Baltimore, he defended the Trump administration’s COVID-19 response saying that they
have worked to provide the best of medical facilities while he also attacked Biden on various
issues. The emotional angle was played yet again when the Second Lady Karen Pence took
the stage and stated how the Trump Administration has provided for military families,
considering that her own family is one of them. Next, Kellyanne Conway spoke about how
Trump has advocated for, promoted, and worked towards women rights by elevating them
to senior positions in business and government. She also praised Trump for his unwavering
support when she was coordinating the White House efforts on combating the drug crisis.
Iowa Senator Joni Ernst also spoke about Trump’s support for farmers while she also
criticized and slammed the Democrats’ Green New Deal. But it should be kept in mind that
despite the Phase One Deal between USA and China, relations between both the countries
are still unstable and well, considering Trump’s philosophies, nothing much can be said. One
interesting fact about Day 3 was that one of the speakers, Representative Dan Crenshaw of
Texas, did not mention Trump by name although he did state that The Trump administration
by defeating the ISIS caliphate, has restored America’s power.<br>
On the last day of the Convention, many speakers like Alice Johnson, Kayleigh McEnany and
Daniel Cameron provided for a diverse line-up, all with a personal story to share, of how
Trump had helped them and supported them. This has really put the emotional angle in
place with Trump having people sharing personal stories and having all his four adult
children speaking in the Convention.<br>
But soon enough, the pandemic again came into question in the pandemic considering the
fact that the crowds on Days 3 and 4 of the Convention were not wearing masks which even
further highlights how Trump has downplayed the pandemic. Another highlight was how the
statements passed by the Republican speakers and Trump himself were nothing but false
allegations against Biden with almost all of them proving to be the exact opposite of the
ideas that Biden has promoted and spread publicly. Last but not the least, Trump used the
White House not only to deliver his speech but also use it as a tool in his speech to try to
promote his chances for reelection. Trump and his party did not shed light on their policies
and beliefs with regard to the upcoming elections.<br>
While the Biden campaign is chugging along with a successful Democratic National
Convention, and Trump leaving no stones unturned to attempt to secure his reelection, it is
yet to be seen who wins. However, it is clear that the odds are looking in Joe Biden’s favour.
As Kimberly Guilfoyle exuberantly said as part of her speech, “The best is yet to come”.</p>
