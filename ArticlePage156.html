                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Music - has always enthralled the audience but, within those beautiful melodies exist, such apostles of change and progress have taught us lessons. They have enlightened us about the basic values which surround the living of humankind and much, more importantly, they have played an extremely important role in eradicating the wrongs that have come and gone in our slightly run off the mill planet Earth. <br><br>

I will be enunciating on five iconic songs that have brought a change within the society but, at the same time - there are a lot more. We need to keep on exploring and finding new compositions which also teach us something fruitful rather than always going by melodic dexterity. <br><br>


1.) Imagine - John Lennon.<br><br>

<i>"Imagine there's no countries<br>
It isn't hard to do<br>
Nothing to kill or die for<br>
And no religion too<br>
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you"</i><br><br>

We all have heard this, and this one is said to be the signature of the phenomenal lead singer of the Beatles. The song strongly speaks about world peace and harmony but at the same time, it's not a politicized composition. As Lennon has said," the track is anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic…but because it’s sugar-coated, it is accepted by the masses" The song rose to prominence after the assassination of Lennon in 1980 and stands to be one of the most popular and revisited tracks of all time. <br><br>

2.) Blowin' in the wind - Bob Dylan.<br>

Hilariously, I have a very slight and fading away reminiscence of swaying my hands and gleefully singing this masterpiece composition in one of the posh clubs of Calcutta when I was a mere toddler. Every single one of you must have some memory associated with this particular song...isn't it? There have been various adaptations of this song and the very reason why the song appeals to all is that it consists of the deepest poetry that has ever been tailored upon in a modern mainstream song. It's an all-in-one song for peace and harmony whereas, at the same time, it also emphasizes the issues that were raging the world around the time when the song was written i.e. the civil rights marches that were of huge significance during the Slapstick Era of the 60s. A few sources also preach this to be an Anti War poem based on the Vietnam war but, personally speaking, I can hugely relate to it with the civil rights movement of the 1960s a lot more than the Vietnam War as the same had not gained momentum at the time.<br><br>

<i>"Yes, 'n' how many times must a man lookup<br>
Before he can see the sky?<br>
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have<br>
Before he can hear people cry?<br>
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take 'til he knows<br>
That too many people have died?<br>
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind<br>
The answer is blowin' in the wind"</i><br><br>

The answer to all these questions Bob Dylan poses through the song is true, present in the wind. They move and they change, but the answers are there. It’s only a matter of trying to pick them up. Inarguably one of the greatest songs which created magnanimous ripples within the society of the late 20th century.

		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "septarticles/5s1.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">3.) Get Up, Stand Up - Bob Marley.<br><br>

<i>"Preacher man, don't tell me, Heaven is under the earth<br>
I know you don't know, what life is really worth<br>
It's not all that glitters is gold, half the story has never been told<br>
So now you see the light, stand up for your rights"</i><br><br>

A song which is completely based upon standing up and revolting against the various issues, predominantly the bigoted doctrines of the Christian Clerics. Bob Marley, brought up in Jamaica highlights the difficulties that he had to face while being a part of the Rastafarian religion which was always overshadowed by Christianity. Rastafarian was a collection of ideologies of the radical African philosopher Marcus Garvey. Marcus Garvey believed that the white man's god was the devil and that the black man's god, Jah, was the one true god. The prime motive of the song is to speak up against religious hypocrisy and it is beautifully gripping on how it beautifully elucidates on not waiting for divine intervention in people's lives. Marley was a very religious individual and hence, he knew what he was doing. The song also asks us not to be overshadowed by the Church or any religious institutions in particular. We are human beings, and thousand-year-old doctrines don't deserve to dictate our independent thought processes.<br><br>

Would it be redundant if I call this song to be "pleasurably anti-religious"? Jesus would approve of this with a grin. Oh, it's also my personal reggae favorite! <br><br>



4.) Strange Fruit - Billie Holiday.<br><br>

<i>"Southern trees bear strange fruit<br>
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root<br>
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze<br>
Strange fruit hanging from the popular trees<br>
Pastoral scene of the gallant south<br>
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth<br>
The scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh<br>
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh"</i><br><br>

A beautifully rendered number, this was written by Abel Meeropol. A very subtle, but touching melody -Meeropol expressed his horror at lynchings, inspired by Lawrence Beitler's photograph of the 1930 lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Marion, Indiana. Interestingly, he wanted the poem to be sung and hence he composed the number. <br><br>
As both a song and a message, the single "Strange Fruit" topped the charts. Billie Holidays beautifully haunting voice over the poetic lyrics of Meeropol served to be a major catalyst for which the song and Holiday, posthumously rose to fame. People were hit to home or personally moved by the extremely relatable wordings employed within the simply powerful composition.<br><br>

5.) A Change Is Gonna Come - Sam Cooke.<br><br>

<i>"It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die<br>
'Cause I don't know what's up there above the sky<br>
It's been a long, a long time coming<br>
But I know a change's gonna come, oh, yes, it will"</i><br><br>

An extremely relevant song in the current times, where the social platforms have profusely taken to the "Black Lives Matter" campaign. Interestingly 66 years back, an amazing singer risked his predominantly white fans to make a song fighting for racial unity in America. Had we properly adhered to the lyrical intensity of the song, George Floyd would have been smiling today. In an intensely hopeful tone, Sam Cooke assures that change will be coming and, police brutality against minorities is on the rise, Black Lives Matter protests eerily echo the civil rights protests of the '60s, and the socioeconomic gap between whites and minorities still exits. But there's no denying that change has come since Sam Cooke got kicked out of a Louisiana Holiday Inn for the colour of his skin in 1963, prompting him to write the song in the first place.<br><br>

The song gains a significant fervor right after America's first Black President, Barack Obama was elected in 2008.<br><br>


There is certainly a lot more to come. Maybe - somewhere out there, someone is still scribbling out those beautiful lyrics which might change the entire perspective at which we look at the world?
