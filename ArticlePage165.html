                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Throughout the 20th century, we made progress in tackling disease, fascism, inequality, and racism. One thing we didn’t tackle so well until towards the end of the century was organized crime. Mussolini came pretty close, using the fascist State to eradicate the business of getting your hands dirty in return for a huge load of money. The Mafia was primarily based in Italy and the United States. So, even if Mussolini did do well with his iron-fist tactics against organized crime, what was the U.S of A doing?<br>
Pretty much the opposite. It’s not like they didn’t try, of course. They made a whole lot of effort to try to mitigate crime, but primarily through law. The execution of which was, in the simplest terms- terrible. This article is about one such effort which needs highlighting- for its peculiarity and the fact that it contributed much to the unexpected rise of one of the most structured and active bootlegging chains in America, operated by Al Capone- possibly one of the most popular of the Mafia Lords, who gave hell to the U.S government for a decade or so- Herbert Hoover’s championed Prohibition.<br>
The Prohibition came into effect as the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified by around 3/4th of the 50 States in January of 1919. It was implemented from 1920 and would see continuance till 1933.
Now, when the government bans or prohibits something-  it ineluctably drives attention to the object or practice under ban. In this case, it was alcohol causing intoxication- it’s manufacture, stockpiling and consumption. This would normally seem hilarious when considering implications for well-established liquor supply chains, but this was not a normal time. World War I had just shook the world- having unavoidable effects on society, and it’s norms. Since it was a post-war era, a ban on a dispensable practice such as intoxication would make economic sense, as it would naturally make space for allocation of funds to the establishment or reinforcement of distribution networks for essential commodities such as food-grains, sanitized water, fuel, etc. <br>
Obviously, Prohibition wasn’t only an economic policy. In truth, it was a major social wave against the prevalence of alcohol in the country’s streets, led by many societies headed by women who faced violence or separation from their sponge husbands due to the latter’s obsession with liquor, Native societies, and more. Drinking alcohol while the biggest crises the world had ever faced were in function, was frowned upon. The country took on a sober outlook because that’s what was ideal.<br>
But when we say “country”, are we talking about all the country’s civilians- or just those in power with their representatives in office? Clearly the latter. Prohibition was achieved. As we progressed into the Roaring 20s, it was clear that abstinence wasn’t. As the Prohibition consolidated itself, young and middle-aged men who depended on alcohol as a primary constituent of their diets, were desperate to get their hands on a pint. Alcohol wasn’t only for the reckless poor. In fact, there was major demand in the urban areas for bootleg liquor, with rich men and their handles buying a major part of the supply. 
One thing you need to understand is that a Mafia family does what it does because nobody else does it. Meaning, it does what is illegal, basically what others fear to do. So, as the Prohibition swept American streets, the irony was- more of these families devoted their resources to the bootlegging business.<br> 
                                        <b>To quote DiCaprio’s character from Django Unchained- <i>“Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. But now you have my attention.”</i></b><br>
What began was the rise of a force which would plague America and it’s primary law enforcement agencies for decades- from Capone to Escobar. 
The families which managed to get their hands on beer and wine from cross-border business transactions, which were fairly easy because of the US’ loose borders and wet neighbours, primarily Canada, advertised their possession of liquor through whisper networks in alleys, youth gangs, and labour and gambling rackets. They used false floorboards, second gas tanks and hidden compartments, in vehicles for camouflage to hide their very valuable, and illegal liquor. Speakeasies- which were basically secret pubs secluded from the attention of the police came into prevalence. As the demand for illegal liquor rose like rockets, and the supply of it was more or less monopolized, prices rose dramatically. The government counted on this to restrict the sale of liquor. However, this was just the initial phase. Supply increased while being monopolized, and price discrimination came into place. A huge underground network was established for sale to the rich and the poor. The only difference being- this underground network was hidden in plain sight.  Millions of money were made. Capone brought in 100 Million dollars a year- that’s more than 1.5 billion dollars today. Let that sink in. <br>
But, it’s natural for you to think, how did they do this? Where was… the government? The police? The Mafia did not have mercy here either. Corrupt networks were put in place, inducing high-ranking policemen- commissioners, captains, you name it. These policemen let off the Families’ sharpshooters, made men, and secluded crime scenes and speakeasies when their presence became visible. That’s funny. When you talk about the police and the Mafia, it’s nothing compared to the latter and the politicians. Major cities’ mayors, were charged with corruption and mobilization of Mafia vote banks in return for letting the Mafia off. Crime roared. The Mafia won. The Prohibitionists lost.
