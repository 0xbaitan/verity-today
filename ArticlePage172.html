<br>
                                 
Is Cargo the first Hindi space film? I did a quick Google search because I couldn’t think of a single other one. Dara Singh made Chand Par Chadayee in 1967, but this might be the first one that follows in the tradition of the space films we know from the West. So, just for that, it’s a major milestone movie. But director Arati Kadav goes further and adds a mytho-fantasy layer to the classic sci-fi space film.
</p>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Cargo is set in 2027. The rakshas or demons we know from our myths have evolved into a humanoid race that sends astronauts into space to live in spacecraft known as Pushpaks to help ferry the dead into reincarnation. All this is so skilfully done that we barely realise that Kadav has very successfully married the melodramatic trope of the afterlife to the quietude of the Hollywood space film. Questions of the soul are par for the course in space, Hollywood has taught us: space missions helped Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong come to terms with his daughter’s death in First Man and Brad Pitt to reunite with his long-lost father in Ad Astra. Here, too, Kadav has Important Questions to ask: what is the meaning of life? What is its purpose? What is the point of living well if those who live badly die just like the rest of us? But these questions are dealt with so lightly, so quietly, with such a meditative touch, that they almost go unnoticed.
</p>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Indeed, I watched Cargo twice before I wrote a single word of this review. The second time, I skipped through the scenes I knew, but lingered on the ones I didn’t pick up on the first time. (This, of course, is the great advantage of the streaming release. When I reviewed Matthias & Maxime, I went back and watched some of the scenes again just so I could absorb them fully.) But before I say more, let me recount what this film is about. Prahastha (a brooding Vikrant Massey, so serious that his occasional smile comes out like the sun) is the sole Post-Death Transition Services agent/rakshas aboard one of the many Pushpak spacecraft that help the dead cleanse themselves before reincarnation. He solemnly goes about his job, receiving the newly dead (the eponymous cargo), divesting them of all their worldly belongings, wiping their memories and then sending them off. One day, his overseer Nitigya sir (Nandu Madhav is just as sweet as he was in Harishchandrachi Factory), who communicates with him via video from Earth, informs him that he has been assigned an assistant. Prahastha is resistant, but he has no choice. Before long, he is joined by Yuvishka (Shweta Tripathi), and together they carry out their duties. Yuvishka, like any other rakshas, has a special power: she can heal the dead, wipe their bodies of any wounds they have sustained. She is perkier than Prahastha (Tripathi is so good at perky) and her methods are more evolved than his. This causes some initial friction, but when she successfully demonstrates her healing power, Prahastha is reluctantly impressed.
</p>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
But very soon, after encountering several less than satisfied dead people, Yuvishka begins to question the meaning of it all. She makes regular vlogs for her online followers and in one she asks, if, after we die, all the stories we were involved in die too, what was the point of everything? She realises that death negates (or at least renders useless) all our earthly actions and relationships. This feeling of disillusionment causes her to lose her healing powers.
</p>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Eventually, we, the viewers, come to see that Prahastha has also been through a similar period of questioning and that his response has been to become hardened and cynical about the ways of life. This is brought out in a delicate scene about three-quarters of the way through (one of those that needs more than one viewing), where Kadav and her actors, in the best way, say a lot by saying little.
</p>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The film’s pensive tone and pacing are matched by Shezan Shaikh’s contemplative score, which relies on both silences and piano. But Cargo is never plodding or depressing; this is because Kadav runs small threads of humour through her scenes. One time, an entire wedding party dies in a bus crash and turns up in Prahastha and Yuvishka’s Pushpak, creating a brouhaha in the otherwise quiet confines of the craft. Another time Prahastha goes to bed in a t-shirt whose slogan reads, ‘Keep calm, you’re already dead’. Then there’s the Hinglish pop song that Yuvishka jams to; its words go ‘I’m your forget-me-not, I’m always in your thoughts, dil mein hai, there’s no doubt, you’re my forget-me-not!’ (I advise watching this film with subtitles on.)
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Cargo works like a quiet charm. I enjoyed the production design (complete with e-newspapers whose headlines scream, ‘YANTRIK RAKSHAS PROTEST BREAKS OUT’) and special effects, and then I slowly realised that the film was saying more than what may appear at first glance. It’s so carefully made, with small clues dropped silently well before a reveal, that writing too much about it seems to puncture its effect. Ultimately, it gives meaning to that line from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone: ‘After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.’
