I had been intrigued by the ‘woh’ in the title of Alankrita Shrivastava’s new movie. The ‘chamakte sitare’ (twinkling stars) part makes sense. Dolly (Konkona Sensharma) is asked by a delivery boy to give him five stars for his services and Kaajal (Bhumi Pednekar) remarks that despite being afraid of the dark she knows that it’s only at night that the stars come out. But ‘woh’ (those) suggests distance, as though the stars are not quite within their reach. It reminded me of one of my favourite quotes by Oscar Wilde: ‘We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.’ Dolly and Kaajal, cousins, are both living difficult lives, but I think that both of them are indeed looking at the stars.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Shrivastava also thought of this particular line from Lady Windermere’s Fan. After all, this is a film that references both William Blake (To see a world in a grain of sand/And a heaven in a wild flower/Hold infinity in the palm of your hand/And eternity in an hour) and Virginia Woolf (someone needs ‘a room of her own’).
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Of course, you don’t have to make these associations to enjoy Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare. Part of its charm – and this was also true of Shrivastava’s previous film, the ‘lady-oriented’ Lipstick Under My Burkha – is its grounding in the very desi environs of Greater Noida. The characters are not upper class, English-educated city slickers. In fact, they are the very contrary: Dolly and Kaajal are from a backward caste in Bihar. Kaajal moves to Greater Noida to find work and escape an arranged marriage, and she briefly stays in Dolly’s home. Dolly is married to Amit (Aamir Bashir) and has two young children, besides a small-time job at an office where it is assumed she will make tea for her colleagues.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Kaajal, uncomfortable at Amit’s unwanted advances, decides to find accommodation in a hostel. In the process, she quits a perfectly serviceable job in a shoe factory (I couldn’t fully make out why) and takes up a more questionable one at a nighttime call centre. Here, she is an employee of the Red Rose app, where she fields phone calls under the persona of Kitty from lonely gentleman callers and gives them, over the phone, what she can in terms of sexual/romantic satisfaction. The first time she does this, she is unsure and almost in tears, but she quickly gains confidence in what she sees as a well-paying, reliable job – plus she gets free food!
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Meanwhile, Dolly has her own set of problems. She and her husband share an unfulfilling sex life. Her younger child, Pappu, is displaying ‘troubling signs’: wearing a bra to school, visiting the girls’ loo (‘it makes me feel more like a girl’), wishing to visit the doll museum with the girls instead of the train museum with the boys. And, on top of all this, Dolly finds herself drawn to an attractive young delivery boy named Osman Ansari (Amol Parashar, who is wonderful).
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Each woman has to face her fears and her desires. The desires of women is one of Shrivastava’s favourite themes, and they are once again front and centre here. Dolly Kitty is very much a companion piece to Lipstick, and not just because it reunites Shrivastava with both Sensharma and Vikrant Massey. Here, too, repressed and tough lives are the focus. All the characters are hiding something, or struggling with something. There’s Pappu, of course. Kaajal’s friend Shazia (Kubbra Sait, who is unfortunately handed a stock free-spirit character) is having a fling with a rapper whose older brother is a local Hindutva political goon, and so advises his brother to dump his Muslim girlfriend. Kaajal’s co-worker Juhi takes her to a ‘party’, which turns out to be the sort of event where men eye and pick up call girls. When things go south for a soused Kaajal, she flees, weeping. In the taxi, she asks the driver to play bhajans, as if to cleanse herself.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Luckily, Shrivastava elects not to underline this touching moment, a restraint she doesn’t extend to all parts of the movie. When Dolly comes into her own later in the film, she decides to make a cup of tea at work just for herself. The men around her stare, and then Shrivastava ruins the epiphany somewhat by having Dolly say something along the lines of ‘I’ve only just begun to enjoy the taste of tea.’ Another time, a character explains that she is ‘thandi’, which is the reason she hasn’t had sex in two years. You can see Shrivastava wondering whether her SoBo audience will understand this, so the character explains, ‘English mein frigid kehtay hain.’
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
There is also some psychological probing to do with Dolly’s mother, which is pretty underdeveloped. Neelima Azeem turns up as the mother, a woman who felt stifled in her life and left her family. This was so long ago that both Dolly and she need a second to recognise one another. In the brief and slightly awkward scene that follows, Dolly attempts to figure out whether her ‘problems’ (her lack of arousal, Pappu) have origins in her mother’s flight: this is something her husband has suggested. But this film has just too much going on to shoulder hand-wringing about mommy issues, so it skirts around this aspect.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Instead, it wants us to pay attention, obviously, to Dolly and Kitty. Whatever they may have going on in their lives, they always have one another. Where Shrivastava really scores is in refusing to make them blazing feminist icons. Dolly is suspicious of Kaajal’s way of life, repeatedly branding her a slut. Kaajal always fires back in her own defence (she once labels Dolly an aunty for swapping her sarees for a purple top while retaining her mangalsutra), but she has secret misgivings too. Meanwhile, Dolly comes down like a tonne of bricks on Pappu, who, now I come to think of it, may be the one truly feminist icon here: when Dolly finds Pappu at the doll museum decked out in a dress, all Pappu says is, ‘You’ll beat me at home, so let me enjoy myself for now.’
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Both Dolly and Kaajal do questionable things, but neither is judged, or branded a bitch. This is a movie about women finding themselves and living not for men but for one another; yet, the men aren’t dicks. In fact, when Kaajal is ill-treated by a man, you feel less angry with him than frustrated that Kaajal was foolish enough to trust someone she barely knew. Dolly’s husband Amit may be making passes at his sister-in-law, but then is Dolly entirely faithful to him? And does he ever force himself on her?
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I liked these shadings very much, because they make these people real. Shrivastava knows what women want and how they want it – this film is an excellent example of what can be achieved when a woman tells a woman’s story. And there is a welcome attention to detail, whether it’s a mother reprimanding her child with the trademark ‘mm-mm-mm-mm’ when she’s on the phone, or another child counting the floors of the building he’s going to live in. The detail reaches even the less fleshed-out supporting players: there is an awareness, for instance, of what it means to be a Muslim for Shazia and Osman in an increasingly saffronised India. This saffronisation makes a reappearance in the rather bizarre climax, though, which involves (I’m not making this up) a gigantic blow-up vagina, a speech about the empowerment of women and a shootout.
Shrivastava chronicles the lives, loves and lust of these small-town women with colour and verve; what her screenplay lacks occasionally in depth or subtlety she makes up for in humour and by bringing out solid work from all her actors. Konkona Sensharma wrote on her Instagram on Friday, “Grateful to get a good role after so long.” With filmmakers like Shrivastava around, she won’t have to fret for roles, I hope!
