Everyone loves superheroes. Thanks to superhero movies, we always expect the superheroes to be the good guys and saviours of the world. However, we never expect these heroes to turn their backs on people and be selfish instead. Have you ever imagined what would happen if the Justice League or the Avengers were to go rogue? Can you imagine a world where Superman one day starts using his heat vision to chop planes in half, or if Quicksilver runs right through a person's body, without any care? Thanks to 'The Boys', that question has now been answered.

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
An Amazon Prime Video original show, 'The Boys', directed by Eric Kripke, was released midway through 2019 and made its way into the hearts of all its fans. Adapted from the 2006 comic series named the same, written by Garth Ennis, the show introduces a world where superheroes are not the same old symbols of justice, but rather the actual villains. It is a frequently used concept, but 'The Boys' without a doubt, executes in the best way.

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The show has a dark theme, accompanied by humour, violence, bloodshed, action, mystery, and of course, superheroes. Superheroes are as popular as celebrities, as powerful as politicians, and for some, they are revered as gods. Yet, that is what the public sees. In reality, these same superheroes could be corrupt and selfish, looking only for money, fame, and power. 'The Boys' takes this concept and puts it right onto the screen, filled with brilliant combat sequences, an intricate plot, spectacular CGI effects, and a loveable cast. In the very first episode, we are introduced to most of the major characters of the show and also the dark and gritty nature of it. In this universe, being a superhero is a paid job, with these heroes being treated as celebrities who not only save the world but also star in their own movies and have their very own merchandise and they are all owned by Vought, the multibillion-dollar conglomerate that manages the superheroes. And as with real-life celebrities, there is a constant popularity contest among the superheroes to see who will be the most adored and loved ones and atop this popularity ladder sit 'The Seven'. 'The Seven' are as the name suggests the seven most popular superheroes and their leader and founder of 'The Seven' is the malicious and conniving Homelander, played by the talented Anthony Starr.  'The Boys' shows how easily corrupted the superheroes can become due to their powers and their thirst for fame and money is endless. They believe to be above the law and to stop them, 'The Boys', a rag-tag group of ordinary people, led by Billy Butcher, played by the magnificent Karl Urban, aim to fight the superheroes and take them and Vought down once and for all.

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The first season had 8 one-hour long episodes of intense action and drama, filled with turns and twists. The two characters which are quintessential to the show are without a doubt Homelander and Butcher. Homelander is considered a god amongst men and loved by the public, but in reality, he is filled with pride and hatred towards anyone who dares to challenge him. Homelander is the symbol and pride of Vought and all heroes, but Butcher knows the real nature of this god. Butcher always thinks on his feet and is always ready to go face to face with anybody, even Homelander. To a certain extent, he is like Homelander, manipulative and cunning, yet we also see his gentle side throughout the show, making him a far more down to earth and relatable character. Anthony Starr and Karl Urban in their roles as Homelander and Butcher, respectively, bring out the best of their characters, making them instant fan favourites. Hughie Campbell is the main protagonist of the show. Hughie is a shy and weak person but wants to fight for justice and get revenge for his fianc√©e. He always helps 'The Boys' however he can and puts his life at risk numerous times. The show also has brilliant side characters with their own stories, making the show much more fledged out and incredible world-building, with the creators of the show putting in extra effort to make everything seem realistic yet unique, for example, Spotify being replaced by 'Voughtify', showing the power and authority Vought have in this universe. 

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The show is dark and gory and is not meant for everyone, but those who can look past the gore will see a magnificent show, with superb CGI, directing, acting, and production. The show does not lack in any region and its second season has already been released on Prime Video.  Rated an 8.7 on IMDB, the show is a must-watch and can be easily binged in just a few sittings.
