Jacques Berman Webster (II) better known today as Travis Scott is easily one of the most happening rappers of the day and he keeps on getting more and more famous by the day. From getting his own Fortnite event to having his own McDonald’s meal, he really has been thriving even during this apocalyptic year. But life hasn’t always been like this for him; like many other rappers and celebrities he almost started off with nothing. Travis Scott has been active as a rapper since 2012 and whilst building up on his career he had to give up on a lot like having to drop out of college. But it’s obvious that all his efforts paid off!
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Now that I’m seeing so many people listening to his music and becoming fans (not the stereotypical Fortnite kids who found him on Fortnite, let’s not talk about them for now!) they all have listened to his albums- ASTROWORLD(his most recent in 2018), Birds in the Trap Sing By McKnight(2016) and Rodeo(2015) I’ve realised that the new fans don’t know much about a mixtape that include his songs from before Rodeo. And it’s sad because the songs are all awesome, and I’ll be honest with you, I too took a lot of time to start discovering them and I’m happy I did. I’m going to be talking about some of my personal favourite tracks from the mixtape because I believe it needs way more recognition from the new fans and basically everyone who is into the rap music genre.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Now the mixtape is about Travis Scott a.k.a. Laflame(a word he uses for himself in a lot of songs, also a very accurate word because he’s extremely energetic and fiery as an artist and he likes to rage, his rise to fame and girls and stuff, rappers normally rap about, but somehow I wouldn’t categorise it as something similar to a lot of his other works. The first song that was released from the mixtape is called “Don’t Play”. Probably the catchiest song I’ve ever heard by him. The moment I listened to it the tune got stuck in my head. It still is actually. But it’s not like his other songs aren’t catchy, I just felt that the tune of the song goes so hard that it really did have some impact on me. The song features Big Sean who was at the time much more popular than Travis was (how the tables have turned!). Next song I’ll be talking about is probably the most popular song from the mixtape- Mamacita. Again, a great song, it has a really strong beat. The song is again about the rappers of the song- Rich Homie Quan, Young Thug and Travis Scott’s respective “Mamacitas” basically. One of my other personal favourites is Backyard which is about his coming up and the experiences since he got into fame. Unlike the other more catchy numbers, what attracts me to the song are the lyrics which I somehow am able to understand without having to search them up which is totally an achievement when it comes to rap music. They’re all extremely vibey songs. All of Travis’s songs are good to vibe to but these songs have a different vibe altogether. Probably because they were written and produced before he properly blew up, you get this fresh different feel from them. And listening to it after listening to all his newer songs, I don’t know how to explain it but I get this feeling of nostalgia even though I probably had never even heard of Travis Scott in 2014 when the mixtape was released which is for sure weird but cool at the same time?
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I wish I could go into depth when it comes to the Days Before Rodeo but I’ll be honest when I say that I’m still yet to learn more about it as I too was pretty late in discovering it (it’s not like it’s hidden or anything, I was just very engrossed listening to his other songs which are awesome too and I think I got carried away and didn’t feel the need to dig in any further, yikes). Nevertheless, I have heard all the songs and they all certainly do send a different vibe from Travis’ other work and if you like his songs like SICKO MODE and Goosebumps and want to get more into his music, please do go through his older ones too because you, for sure are missing out!
