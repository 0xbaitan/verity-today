After days of clues and short clips teasing a new music video, Lady Gaga finally released a short film for a fan-favourite song from Chromatica, 911. Note that Gaga herself refers to it as a short film and not as a mere video: one look at it will explain her rationale behind this decision. Not only is the film packed with gorgeous visuals and stunning cinematography, but it also follows a coherent plot backed up by the lyrical content of 911 itself, and the general theme of Chromatica. However, one view of the short film isn’t adequate to unravel the complexities at work here, so be sure to watch the video a few times before reading ahead. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
For the sake of clarity, it is necessary to track a rough synopsis of the video. It starts out on a desert landscape with sand dunes sparkling all around, and the camera pans to a horseman standing over Gaga sprawled on the ground, beside a broken bicycle and scattered pomegranates. Standing up, she collects herself and walks over to a churchyard containing a number of individuals wearing flashy clothes and costumes. One man lying prostrate repeatedly bangs his head onto a pillow while another woman hugs a mummified body wrapped in bandages and cries to herself. The central figures of this tableau are a man dressed in black, and a woman dressed in white with a red cross patch on her breast. These two figures enter the scene holding a spinning umbrella, using which they levitate from the rooftops and approach Gaga. Other notable characters include two groups dressed in yellow and blue respectively, and a trio of figures standing at the periphery of the scene, holding a long metal rod. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Gaga is seen to be dancing in some ritual throughout the film, while the two umbrella characters are attempting to guide her. The red cross woman flashes a mirror into her eyes, and near the end of the first half of the film, a mural is seen depicting a terrible car accident and people dying on the street. The end of this first section shows Gaga being led to a huge throne to be sacrificed, and just as the man plunges a knife into her heart, the scene switches to the very mural that had been presented earlier, but now in real-time. Gaga lies on a stretcher and wakes up, and a paramedic and a police officer stand above her, played by the same actors who played the umbrella duo. Slowly, bits of information are revealed to the viewer, allowing them to piece together the basic plotline of the film. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Gaga has suffered a bicycle accident, which explains the bicycle in the opening desert scene of the film. In her unconscious state, she has dreamed up the manifestations within the churchyard, with all the characters in her dreams being some altered, hallucinogenic perceptions of the people at the site of the crash. The duo with the umbrella are the paramedics who arrive at the scene in a helicopter, while the yellow and blue groups and firefighters and police officers respectively. The red cross woman flashing a mirror into Gaga’s eyes is in actuality a flashlight trying to wake her back up. All this is, of course, hinted at during the dream sequence itself, most notably in the mural. One portion of the sequence also shows Gaga in a halo floating up to the sky, only to be brought down to earth by the umbrella pair with a rope tied to her leg. This rope is later revealed to be a tourniquet in real-life tied around her damaged foot: as Gaga was slipping away and close to death, the paramedics succeeded in saving her life and bringing her back down to the ground. The shock ending is even hinted at here, with the scene switching to Gaga on the stretcher for a millisecond as she comes crashing down to the ground. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The entire crash scene is set in front of a movie theatre, whose signage explains that the ‘Armenian Film Festival’ is currently ongoing. This, along with the scattered pomegranates in the opening scene, is a cheeky nod by Gaga to ‘The Colour of Pomegranates’, an Armenian movie that is considered to be one of the best films of all time. Much of the imagery, costumes, and concepts of the dream sequences are inspired by this film itself, providing for much representation and diversity within her artistic vision. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Although the plot of the film may be explained, it is after all, still a music video: how does it fit in with the actual song 911? Gaga has spoken time and again about how Chromatica was meant to be a healing album, which took her through her mental health struggles as a form of catharsis. Perhaps 911 is the most representative song of this album. In an interview with Zane Lowe, Gaga explained the concept behind 911, encapsulated within the chorus lyric “My biggest enemy is me, pop a 911”. Here, ‘911’ refers to an antidepressant, considered to be her support system and emergency resort just as the 911 hotline is. So dependent was she on her medication that it became vital to her existence. The pills are referenced within the video itself- when Gaga finally wakes up from her dream, she screams, and cries out, “I didn’t have my pills.” One can assume that the accident took place because of Gaga being of unsound mind, having not taken her pills while riding her bicycle, once again driving home the motif that her biggest enemy really is herself. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
The film fades out to the orchestra that plays at the beginning of Gaga’s collaboration with Elton John, ‘Sine From Above’. Although this may be a mere coincidence or a hint at the next single for the album, it could also be continuing the storyline of the car crash as a symbol for her failing mental health. ‘Sine From Above’ talks of music being a healing force in her life, which came down from heaven and restored her vitality (hence ‘sine’ as in a sound wave, and not ‘sign’), and Gaga being pulled out of her comatose state with the song of 911 could serve as a testament to the fact. A characteristic of good art is a piece that is always up for interpretation, and that is what Gaga has succeeded to do. With a meaningful plot that is rich in diversity, costume design, and a beautiful message, 911 is sure to be a staple within the pop landscape for years to come.
