<center><b><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> WARNING:SPOILER ALERT</b></center>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Recently, I re-watched How I Met Your Mother for the second (or third, i really can’t remember) time. The show which spanned 9 seasons and created a wonderful framework within which 5 totally different characters with varied aspirations and backgrounds, has been heavily attacked for it’s abruptly “gooey” finale. “But this topic is so overdone, move on!” Believe me, i’ve tried. Regardless, the Ted inside me started latching onto the issue of this finale as I finished devouring season 9. I, too, on first thought- was ready to curse Carter Bays and Craigh Thomas for this abomination of a finale thrown at us. However, on further analysis of all the seasons which come before season 9, I realised- maybe the Finale was the most appropriate ending to the show. When I say appropriate, I do not mean of the highest popularity/quality. We crossed that line a long time back. When i say appropriate, I mean “fitting”. Let me explain.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
To really examine the finale, we need to explore the different conclusions that Last Forever makes to the highly speculated sub-plots of the show, and more specifically season 9.
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I believe none of us hate how Marshall and Lily’s Italy vs Judgeship plot was handled (which finally culminated in the exposition of Lily’s second pregnancy), the show-makers do particularly well with them as a couple and as entertaining individuals. No, no, the problem really lies with the other 3 in the group, and the Mother who the show bases it’s ultimate destination upon. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Therefore, we have to look at four different conclusions-
<ul> <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
<li> <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Barney and Robin’s sudden divorce
<li><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Barney becoming a father (and the way he does)
<li><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Tracy (the Mother)’s elusive, and unfathomable death
<li><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Ted and Robin’s most disputed kinda-sorta patchup (this is the most controversial of them all, so i’ve placed it at the end of our nonverbal communication)</ul>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Let’s begin.
<center><b><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
BARNEY AND ROBIN’S DIVORCE
</b></center>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">I believe this is the second-most disputed sub-topic, after Ted and Robin’s romantic ending. There are two reasons to this-
<ul><li><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Barney and Robin were amazing together.
<li><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Their relationship was different from conventional, gooey and romantic relationships- the kind of relationships HIMYM clearly romanticizes throughout the show. </ul>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
That doesn’t mean they were perfect, or their relationship was flawless. The show itself mentions amidst the moments of tension between Barney and Robin what we all knew. They were too similar, too non-resinous, too individualistic to be together, as a happy couple with sustainable affection. Don’t get me wrong, both of them loved each other to possibly a cosmic extent, but not in a way which can maintain a bond through thick and thin. Robin does not express her love through words, Barney is also emotionally unavailable. Robin is also physically and mentally unavailable- she’s never in the US and is anywhere but owing to her top-notch job at World Wide News (her dream career), which is the immediate reason for their divorce. It was pretty apparent in the locket sub-plot where Barney fails to show up, and at the end of s9 ep20 when Robin’s Mom asks her if Robin has someone she can trust with everything and depend upon, Robin looks off into the distance and says she does. It is almost crystal clear at that time that Robin is thinking about Ted. I’d implore you to watch that scene again if you believe otherwise. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I believe it rather unjust to feel that their divorce was an ugly one, because it happened on an honest basis and the showmakers in the finale eradicated any potential scenario where there exists a feeling of resentment between Barney and Robin. Both of them are good at coming to terms with reality, which makes this divorce a sensible one. 
<center><b><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
BARNEY BECOMING A FATHER
</b></center>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
I think we can all agree this was adorable. It was possibly the most legen-wait-for-it-dary part of the show for me. But a few questions arise. Is Barney responsible enough to be a father? Why does the mother abandon the child to him anyways?
If you asked the first question in S1, the answer would be a clear-as-day No-NO. But if you ask by season 9, it’s a yes. Barney’s character revolves around womanizing, partying, calling himself awesome, high-fives, and well, suits costing 4 craploads. 
But we always knew Barney was a softie. The only reason he became the man with the Playbook was essentially because his long-time girlfriend dumped him for a rich jerk. The show develops his character subtly, gradually, and commendably. They show Barney’s capability to love, feel, and inhibit his tendency to lie and cheat through his relationships with Quinn, and Robin. He’s tired of the facade that he puts up as the embodiment of an awesome personality, and finds his soulmate in Robin, who also leaves him. What many HIMYM fans fail to perceive is that Barney is in some ways, just like Ted. A hopeless soul in need of love, which he has failed to find in a woman due to his peculiar character. Him having a daughter fits perfectly, because she’ll be the one who supplies the love he needs, will perhaps give him a lesson or two on respecting women, and will look at him in an innocent and forgiving light- not being bugged by everything he was.
<center><b><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
TRACY'S DEATH
</b></center>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
This was a criticised plot direction. Viewers were being led to a disclosure of who consolidates herself in Ted’s heart, and that took us through the scores of girls he dated. When we finally meet the mother, we’re amazed. But something looked eerie. The mother isn’t there for even one episode beside Ted while he narrates the story. In one of the episodes, while Ted tells Tracy about Robin’s wedding and how her mother shows up, Tracy says “Which mother wouldn’t show up for her daughter’s wedding?” Tears fill up Ted’s eyes, and Tracy starts to comfort him. This is the first hint at her forthcoming death in the show. The showmakers never really reveal what sickness Tracy really dies of. Honestly, for me- this was a bit too far-fetched. Not the point of her death, but how she dies. However, when considering the whole directive of Ted narrating his story to his children, the mother’s death fits. Ted spends 10 years of his life looking for “the one”. He was not in love with many of the women who came in his direction, but he was in love with the idea of one who would appreciate his quirks. He met that woman, married her, and his search was over. Tracy leaving made Ted realise what HIMYM as a show yearns to teach- Live in the moment with the people you love most, because the present isn’t always the future. Knowing and getting to love Tracy was enough for Ted, and if the writers didn’t designate her death- this lesson wouldn’t be as well delivered. 
<center><b><p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
TED AND ROBIN GET BACK TOGETHER
</b></center>
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Why? WHY? Okay, i know how much this is hated. There are a lot of people who absolutely smash the show for it’s finale, and there is a small percentage who love the finale (these are normally people who like cheesy endings and a rom-com tint to everything.) I do not identify as the latter. I believe the ending of the show completely trumps what it claims to stand for, there are things wrong with Ted and Robin getting back together. All the lessons on moving on are forgotten. All truths about living in the past are ignored. Did Ted still love Robin while he was in love with Tracy? If yes, then that means Tracy really wasn’t the one. It was Robin all along. Worst yet- DOESN’T TED VIOLATE THE BRO-CODE? But it’s not so simple.
Throughout the show, Ted has loved Robin. It’s not even funny what lengths he goes to for her. In S9, his love was most explicit to the viewers. And towards the end of Season 9, we get to know that Robin still loves him. Believe it or not, the show’s romantic framework was designed around them. Ted and Robin were completely different when compared to one another. This contradicting characteristic led them to break up in s3. Ted and Tracy were too similar, and so were Barney and Robin. Still, Robin needed someone who cared for her, respected her independence, and understood her prioritizing her work, and in that course- displaying her emotional unavailability. Ted always accepted all these shades of Robin. And Robin, though arguably selfish, always loved Ted for it. The show’s finale wasn’t designed to cater to our needs. Though, maybe that’s exactly why it was designed the way it was. Regardless, it all fitted. Ted’s love for Robin might have blossomed years after Tracy passed, which was understandable. And Robin missed Ted’s importance and presence in her life since she got divorced. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">
Despite all criticisms, How I Met Your Mother really was about the journey of Ted meeting Tracy. Tracy is not just the character, but she’s embodied in all of Ted’s struggles and failures he goes through before ending up with her. So yes, HIMYM doesn’t miss the point. It just says that there’s more to it.
