<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity of American life today can ignore the present war. If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read “Vietnam”. 
As Lyndon B Johnson, President Of The United States launches a full-fledged de facto war in Vietnam against communist insurgents, Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a powerful speech on the 4th Of April, 1967- a year which would see 11,363 U.s. personnel, a majority of them young adults drafted unwillingly into the military, die. The following year, would see more casualties- 16,899 U.S Personnel dead. The War would see the deaths of more than 2 million Asian soldiers, and more than 50,000 American soldiers.
This man-made tragedy is what Netflix’s new Original- Trial Of The Chicago 7 bases its' message upon. It does not deliver an opinion directly, but sheds enlightening emphasis upon the struggle of a diverse group of 7 young men in their inspiring activist movement against a superfluous war used as a medium to display power- the cost being democracy, the desegregation of the executive and the judiciary, and the most disheartening- millions of human lives. 
The movie is essentially an accurate piece of satire on today’s political systems, and it opens like many of its' predecessors in the field- with an insight into the social atmosphere to give context to the drama. We see a series of drafting cycles unfold through swapping scenes between LBJ and the average man opening his mail to find that he’s been drafted into the army. Following this, you have clips of Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert Kennedy (the late JFK’s brother), both advocates of civil rights favoured highly in public opinion, being assassinated- possibly by a power which is too quick at covering up it’s sins. This sets the base of the movie, which is a socio-political environment calling for revolution within society. President John F. Kennedy, a globalist and strong advocate of nuclear non-proliferation, looking to deal with the Communists in a diplomatic way, is assassinated and the voice of the youth is obstructed. The same happens with MLK and Kennedy’s brother Robert who was assassinated right after he was on a consistent run in possibly being nominated  as the Democrat nominee to the Presidential Run. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Sorkin follows up this dramatic assertion of inbuilt urgency for action with introducing the protagonists- also in continuous series, using subtle build-up music to give us the notion that they are indeed going to make this movie political, but with a very high standard of characterization. We see Eddie Redmayne (a phenomenal actor, you can’t go wrong with him) portray a subtle revolutionary, curious but dignified- a kind of character Eddie specialises in. Then we get the initial piece of our one and only Sacha Baron Cohen- the very same Aladeen, the very same Borat. I tell you, this man is so versatile. It’s visible in the movie as Sorkin directs him to play a hippy comedian who has a hint of genius, something Cohen pulls off just right. All the other supporting actors are just fine, they’re excellent, but it would be a hoax if i did not mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt who’s deliberately framed as the albeit reluctant antagonist in the movie. Plot-wise, he’s definitely a rival to the cause of our protagonists, but his character is written in such a way that he’s an open-minded, highly-skilled lawyer who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, placing him under the authority of the at-the-time, shady U.S. Government. We see this character conflict crop up when he very kindly debates with the Attorney-General about how the government might have been unreasonable, and then quickly admits that indeed, the protests were a display of anarchist tendencies. A  successful attempt to alter character through conversational dialogue.
As the movie progresses, and the trial of the seven activists begins, we have some comic relief brought to us. It’s not absolutely comic relief, but I don’t know what else to call it. It’s Frank Lagella, also the man who played U.S. President Richard Nixon in Nixon/Frost. Here, he plays a white conservative judge bent on enforcing reactionary ideals in a court demanding justice of the reckless government, and boy does he play the character well! Throughout the movie, this guy is SO outrageously hateable, making his stupidity astounding, making the viewers cringe at the demographic system of the United States, clearly biased towards old and cranky white men. He asks the jury to step out and not hear the strongest testimony the young defendants and their lawyer have, to offer and make their case. 
Former Attorney-General of the United States, a very high position in the government, testifies- “An investigation by our criminal division led to the conclusion that the riots were started by the Chicago Police Department.”
The case is clear. The final argument has been laid bare, but then Lagella’s character declares that the jury cannot hear the A.G speak. This is possibly the most significant moment in the movie, where the whole cast has to shine in their specific characters, and define the injustice of a government which represses freedom of speech and the rule of law in a single scene. Michael Keaton’s short role as former A.G. is on-point, and we rarely see any deviation from quality. 
The movie is coming close to the end, and we have a scene alone with the defendants discussing their prospects alone. Sorkin counts on this scene to demonstrate the anger, determination and hostility associated with the injustice portrayed in the previous scene described above. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
“If blood is gonna flow, then let it flow all over the city.”
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
And the riot begins. This is a possible climax in the film, and we have scenes symbolising dissent, and the horrible- horrible police brutality that has started to define the broken policing system in America. 
Something commendable about this movie is- in the midst of all this action, Sorkin doesn’t spare the music, but uses it appropriately like an instrument to underline the situation as a dramatic supplement. The riots have requisite dramatism given to them by the heavy metal background music- a genre which has defined the angrily progressive teenage community that exists today, and has evidently existed since World War II. 
What Redmayne’s character says about blood flowing all over the city comes to light, the government completely devours this opportunity, things are picked out of context and pushed in- and we have a successful delivery of injustice.
Sorkin used this unfortunate plot direction as an instrument to give us a powerful ending- a classically wise thing to do. As all our progressive heroes are deemed guilty for contempt of government, Tom Hayden (again, Eddie’s character) is asked to give a brief statement to the court on behalf of the defendants. He is asked to make it brief, respectful and remorseful. Sorkin here drives down the pace of the scene, building up suspense in us- “What’s Eddie gonna say?”
Tom Hayden goes on to name every mercenary that has given his life in Vietnam in a purely political war since their trial started. This ending is highly dramatic, which is what gives it power. Everyone except a select few in the court stand in respect to the martyrs. The movie is over, and the credits start rolling.
Now, this movie did have certain flaws- Sorkin slowed it down too much in the middle, giving a tedious trial too much attention. He could’ve better channeled that time towards looking into the implications of the murders of 3 huge progressive political figures in plain sight of the country. Looking into the  dynamics of the Black Panther Party back then would’ve been a highly entertaining take on the civil rights scenario. 
But as I have described above, the movie creates a sensation of its' own. It says that yes, being political is the only option when your own government represses you as your leaders die and your friends die in superfluous combat. As a Netflix Original- it’s one of the best on the shelf. Just as the media is drowning out being controlled by the politicians, this movie ranks highly along with others of it’s kind and delivers a message not secondary to the likes of activists. 
Movies do have the power for change, for activism, for delineation of political injustices- and if this amateur production is not an epitome of it, we don’t know what is.
