<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Typically observed from November 13th - 19th each year, and culminating in the sombre Transgender Day of Remembrance on November 20th, this weeklong occasion which seeks to highlight trans issues and build visibility finds its origin in a story written in blood. On the 28th of November 1998, African-American transwoman Rita Hester was brutally murdered in her apartment in Boston. The latest in a volley of onslaughts against the LGBTQ+ community and mere weeks after the murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming, Hester’s death garnered next to no media attention and remained largely underreported, and her murder unsolved. 
Pioneered by activist Gwendolyn Ann Smith in her memory, the Transgender Day of Remembrance is a vigil. It commemorates and immortalizes the countless trans lives, just like Hester’s, that have been lost to prejudice and hate crimes. Today, two decades after her death, the world is facing what many advocates refer to as “an epidemic of anti-trans violence” (NBC News). This year is set to witness record-breaking incidents of acts of brutality against trans people since organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign began to track transgender homicides in 2013. So far, 2020 has already seen the murders of at least 36 transgender or gender non-conforming people, with thousands of others believed to not have been reported or discovered at all. As the Black Lives Matter movement sweeps the United States of America and forces into light the institutional racism that influences everything from American policymakers to their healthcare system, it is impossible to talk about terminal anti-trans violence without mentioning that it disproportionately affects trans women of colour, who make up an overwhelming percentage of the victims. Discrimination faced at the intersections of racism, transphobia and unbridled access to guns tends to force them out of employment, education, medical and other such opportunities as well. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">  
Even today, when the LGBTQ+ community is making progress worldwide in terms of legislation, destigmatization and representation, public spaces are still not safe for transgender persons. Most world governments have no cohesive long term plans of action for their protection and securing their rights. For example, the proposed amendment to the Civil Rights Act in the United States, the Equality Act seeks to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in housing, employment, healthcare, federal funding, etc. However, the bills remain with the US Senate even after over a year has passed since they received it for consideration, leaving the future of this legislation uncertain, and trans people as vulnerable to discrimination as always. Though the world is adapting to the emerging diversity in gender expression, the harmful stigma that still surrounds identifying outside the binary is a dangerous opposing force to the trans rights movement. In 2019, 40% of transgender and gender non-conforming youth reported having faced threats or acts of physical abuse owing to their gender identity in their lifetime. Bullying in schools and workspaces contribute highly to plunging mental health and mounting suicide rates among transgender youth. Research shows that even the simple act of being addressed by their preferred pronouns by the people in their lives contributes to bringing down self-inflicted fatalities and suicides among trans persons to almost 50% less than those subjected to continued misgendering. With the coronavirus pandemic raging throughout the world, many trans people have been forced into isolation with violent family members and therefore have limited access to resources for help, which has contributed to the lethal anti-trans violence that 2020 has witnessed. In terms of healthcare, seeking a transition is an expensive and a highly debated matter, as laws policing their bodies keep changing. This year alone, 6 US States moved to restrict trans minors’ access to gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy, and criminalizing the act of medical providers administering such care. 80% of trans people face a range of barriers to accessing mainstream health services and experience anxiety before reaching out to hospitals for treatments, fearing insensitivity, misgendering and discrimination, with intimate care causing the most concern. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">  
In what many consider a victory for the trans community among other marginalized minorities this year, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris scored a sweeping victory over the Trump-Pence administration in their bid to get reelected this year. These elections also witnessed the historical appointment of the first-ever openly transgender state senator, Sarah McBride. This comes after the Trump administration’s four years in office during which they rolled back several Obama-era legislation that was in place to protect the LGBTQ+ community, which Joe Biden has promised to reverse. While an immigrant-born woman of colour being elected to the highest political position in the United States is indeed historical, it is worth remembering that Kamala Harris has a past as a prosecutor who has made decisions that have negatively impacted said communities, too. As Attorney-General in 2015, she backed the state of California’s decision to deny Michelle Norsworthy, a trans woman in a men’s prison, necessary medical surgery for her diagnosed gender dysphoria. It is these things for which the new administration must be held accountable and answerable. 
Transgender Awareness Week has become a worldwide rallying point for the community and its allies. Though different approaches to the commemoration are adopted each year, the central message remains the same- nobody should have to live in fear of their lives simply on being an account of who they are, nor should their basic rights such as education, healthcare and security be up for debate. Transgender persons’ experience globally is one of extreme social exclusion that translates into increased vulnerability to HIV, limited access to legal resources, stunted educational and employment opportunities, etc. to say nothing of the hate and aggression that “defends’ the gender binary and manifests in episodes of extreme violence against trans people. Unfortunately, legal systems often feed into this marginalization as a result of which transgender persons are forced to live in a criminalized context. Laws that criminalize sex work lead to violence on the part of the police, which once again, and unsurprisingly, disproportionately affect trans women in the occupation. Laws and legislation exist for the world to see, but their enforcement is often flimsy or even altogether neglected. One week a year alone is not enough to recognize these disparities, but it is, as we mentioned, a rallying point. As the movement to secure trans rights continues to gain momentum, we must also remember that deconstructing systems of privilege, fighting for justice, and ensuring safety for everyone is above all a practice of empathy, a struggle in which we all have a role to play.
