<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
The recent case of rape and caste-based violence in Hathras has brought to the spotlight the gross discrimination and brutal crimes committed against women and the lower
castes. On 14th September 2020, a 19-year old Dalit woman was allegedly gang raped by four upper caste men in the Hathras District of Uttar Pradesh when she went to collect cattle fodder. The victim died to injuries sustained from the ordeal two weeks later.

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Her mother said the accused had been harassing the victim and her family for months. The autopsy of the victim stated the cause of death was due to injury to the cervical spine by blunt force trauma and referred to rape and strangulation in medical history. On 29 th September her body was forcefully cremated by the Uttar Pradesh police at 2:30am without the consent of the victim’s family. The brother of the victim’s family said that they were locked up in their house, however, Prashant Kumar ADG (law and order) said that consent had been taken. It has been alleged that petrol was used in the burning of the body. 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
The case has received national attention, with Rahul Gandhi, the former President of the Congress Party and Priyanka Gandhi the general secretary of the Congress Party being accosted and detained when they tried to visit the victim’s family on foot after their vehicle had been stopped. They did finally visit the victim’s family but it was dismissed by the BJP as a political stunt. 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Chandrashekhar Azad, President of the Bhim Army, was placed under house arrest for organising a protest demanding justice for the victim, a day after her forced cremation. On 30th September, 5000 sanitation workers of the Valmiki community went on strike demanding justice for the victim. Protests were held across the country demanding justice for the victim and resignation of the Yogi government. 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Several organisations such as the Rashtriya Savarna Parishad actually publicly supported the accused.  Moreover, the National Savarna Council visited the Superintendent of Police and filed a memorandum alleging the family of the victim to be making false accusations. On 4 th October, ex-BJP MLA Rajveer Singh held rally in support of accused. It was attended by members of the RSS, Bajrangi Dal, Rashtriya Mahasabha and many more.

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
The Yogi government has received intense criticism for the handling of the case. Reports have said that they hired a PR firm which sent out press releases on behalf of the government stating that the victim was not raped and that it was a deep-rooted conspiracy and an international plot to incite caste-based violence and defame the Yogi government. The frightening thing about this incident is how people have been supporting the accused although there is ample evidence against them. 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
It is saddening to see how the Centre has kept quiet on this issue, although the safety of women and caste-based violence continues to loom over the fate of the people of this country. The Uttar Pradesh government instead of rendering their support to the victim and her family have gone to extreme measures to make the case look like “fake news”. One must also realise that this is not an isolated incident, Dalit people regularly face violence and especially the women who are very often sexually assaulted and killed and, from what can be understood, the bodies are burnt to destroy the evidence. The government, instead of trying to tackle the problem and help the ones being discriminated against, are trying to suppress them. This incident has put the spotlight on the unspoken violence committed on the basis of caste. This kind of violence is something people try to show as “a thing of the past” or “isolated incidents happening here and there”. However, that is not the case - caste-based discrimination and violence is still a huge problem in our country and perhaps if the government and the politicians tried to tackle the problem and solve it instead of ignoring and suppressing people who try to speak up against it, maybe Hathras could have been avoided. 

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
Another thing which has become very clear due to Hathras, is how politicians try to politicise everything in their favour, regardless of its consequences on the masses. Once Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi tried visiting the victim’s family it was clear that this had become a matter of political importance. Soon enough politicians from the left wing started to render their support to the victim’s family and visit them, while many politicians from the right wing tried to make it sound like it was being exaggerated or it was an “international conspiracy”. The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee held a protest rally condemning the BJP government and rendering her support to the victim and her family. However, one needs to remember how when the Park Street rape case happened, she called the victim a liar and said the story had been fabricated to humiliate her government. Many of the left-wing politicians who have rendered their support to the victim and her family and condemned the government have previously made gender-based discriminatory comments and have helped suppress or stayed silent during other rape cases. While the BJP government came to power with the Prime Minister condemning the number of gender-based crimes in India and talking about women empowerment along with how Delhi has become the “rape capital” of our country, has stayed silent throughout this incident or rendered their support to the Yogi government and, consequently, to the accused.

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
After one point, when it had become a tug of war between the left-wing and the right-wing and the spotlight had shifted from the actual victim to the politicians making comments, some had started to think the victim really would never get justice. However, this incident has also showed us the importance of a free judiciary in a democracy. The Allahabad high court came as a ray of hope providing actual justice to the victim. The court stated that the late-night cremation of the victim was a violation of the human rights of the woman and her family. The court also condemned Prashant Kumar and asked if he had made proper investigation into the comment. The court also said that all political parties should air their views on this matter in such a way as to not disrupt social harmony or infringe upon the rights of the victim’s family.

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
If the Allahabad court remains independent and non-partial hopefully the victim will get proper justice and people will understand the reality and magnitude of the issue. But we still need to realise cases similar to this happen every day, it has happened before, it is happening now and it will continue happening unless the government decides to collectively
tackle the issue.
