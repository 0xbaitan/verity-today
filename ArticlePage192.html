<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 


With 2020 receding and coming to an end, students all over the globe have started focusing on the one key factor that will determine their lives for the next four years, and even beyond: college applications. Application deadlines usually begin in October and November for most universities around the world, and the strenuous feat of completing one’s profile in time to be judged by admissions officers amidst cut-throat competition is not one that is taken lightly. Students often begin preparation a year or two in advance, and the environment that is fostered within the context of such high stakes is conducive to stress and a fear of failure. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has only served to accelerate this anxiety in times when most plans of preparation have been tossed out the window in the light of present crises. As such, I have spoken to a few students from the Batch of 2021 who are currently undertaking the application process, in order to provide a glimpse into the mindset of the average high school student looking to be accepted into a decent college. 
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
In a world where higher education is considered to be the hallmark of knowledge and status, students are urged to get into the perfect school, be it from their parents or teachers, their peers and the rest of society, or from themselves. There are numerous paths that one can take within India itself, with the most popular being engineering and law, which require the JEE and CLAT exams respectively. Both tests have come under a lot of fire recently, with students undertaking protests and filing petitions to the Supreme Court for the cancelling of the JEE exam, rather than risk the health of the candidates. The CLAT examination had also been postponed several times and being forced to prepare for the tests for extended periods of time has had an adverse effect on their well-being. Those preparing to give the tests in 2021 are also under great duress, as the examinations are famous for being some of the most competitive and difficult in the world. Srinjoy Sen, a CLAT-aspirant, has said the following about the test:
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
“Candidates like me who intend to appear for the exam in 2021 have been going through a great deal of stress regarding how to go about our preparation due to the uncertainties regarding the new format of the paper which is unlike what has come before and the platform in which the exam will be conducted.”
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
The United States application system is extremely unique, in that it focuses on a holistic analysis of the student rather than focusing only on their academic performances. While this might seem idealistic in theory, applicants are under immense pressure to build up the perfect portfolio, as merely good grades is barely enough to be admitted to a good school. Community service, social activism, leadership roles, and national awards are only a few arenas students are expected to excel in, and attempting to do well in these fields while maintaining a social life and stable mental state is a herculean task. SATs, AP exams, and subject tests only add on to this, and exorbitant fee structures ensure that most students cannot afford to attend colleges without a sizable financial aid package. Procuring this aid is another obstacle in itself since it is mostly decided on the basis of one’s needs and merits. In a conversation with Agastya Bose, a student in Lucknow, he vented his grievances with the system:
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
“My SAT preparation was extremely gruelling; coaching classes taking place every weekend meant that I couldn’t relax on a Sunday for a major part of my 11th grade. I also somehow managed to prepare for 4 AP exams in the span of just three months, right after my final examination for 11th, something that I wouldn’t recommend anyone to do if they want to preserve their mental health.”
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Singapore, and other popular education spots all give importance to one’s school performance in giving out seats. However, the idea of considering a singular final board examination to decide a student’s future is frankly ridiculous, since contexts in light of that particular test may lead to a performance that does not accurately reflect their true potential. The stress that results from the great weight given to this exam is also undeniable. Moreover, universities in the United Kingdom also recommend extensive preliminary reading be done to prepare students for not only the college courses themselves but for the application interviews as well. For those who suffer from social anxiety and other disorders that make interaction and communication difficult, these interviews pose a challenge, resulting in poor performance. Ishan Saikia succinctly puts forth the dilemma being faced by every 17 year old across the world at this moment:
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
“The long and complicated process of college admissions adds nothing but additional pressure on top of the already demanding final year of school. I can happily look forward to college life, but the hectic process of researching and filling out applications for each and every college is tiring and even agonising at times.”
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;"> 
That the timeline for the application occurs during the half-yearly and pre-board examinations of most Indian students cannot be ignored. The prospect of juggling school tests while creating a profile that sums up one’s personality to decide one’s future is daunting, one that is to be juggled by 16- and 17-year-olds, no less. The anxiety that naturally comes about from such high-pressure situations have been embedded in a flawed system that has been in place for several decades. With the implementation of a new National Educational Policy for India, and great outcries exposing the shortcomings of global education systems which have been highlighted during remote learning, perhaps the time has come for a change to be implemented for the better.
