President of the UFC
Those were the words spoken by UFC boss Dana White in a press conference
when asked about the upcoming fights. Dana almost always follows through on
his statements and did so on his promise to bring all fight fans an amazing card
for July. </p>

		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "articles/piic.png" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">UFC-251 took place on the 12 th of July in the Yas Islands in Abu Dhabi at the Flash
Forum. The card consisting 3 title fights in the Bantamweight, Featherweight and
Welterweight on the main card as well as the long awaited meeting of the two
former Strawweight champions in the womens division. This was one of the first
times one fight card consisted of 3 title fights and hence gained a lot of traction
with the addition of Florida’s Jorge “Gamebred” Masvidal, UFC 251 recorded the
second most PPV buys, since UFC-229 in which Conor “The Notorious” McGregor
faced off against current lightweight champ Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Petr “No Mercy” Yan and the former featherweight champion Jose Aldo, who
came down a weight, fought for the vacant Bantamweight Title in the first fight
on the champion studded main card. It was a round 5 TKO for the young Russian
Petr Yan. It was “No Mercy” Yan who had controlled the entirety of the fight
keeping it at his pace, the Brazilian veteran Aldo did exhibit class and experience
in his striking especially his leg kicks which evoked nostalgia of a prime Edson
Barboza. Neither fighter made a submission attempt with Yan looking to finish
the fight with old-school ground and pound after his successful knockdown. The
referee, Leon Edwards too evoked nostalgia of the man the myth Steve
“Mustache” Mazzagatti, widely renowned as one of the worst referees to ever had
officiated a professional fight, after making a very poor stoppage to the fight
leaving Jose Aldo heavily damaged. Yan was truly letting the world know why he
is called “No Mercy” after brutally knocking Aldo down and hitting the Brazilian
with hammerfists and heavy ground and pound, leaving the viewers in awe and
rightly being crowned the undisputed Bantamweight champion of the world in
Bruce Buffer’s veteran voice. </p>
		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Alexander “The Great” Volkanovski fought Max “Blessed” Holloway for his first
Featherweight title defense and rematch on the co-main event. The fight was
truly a joy to watch with two wonderfully talented fighters in Volkanovski and
Holloway and a nail biting finish with Volkanovski successfully defending his
title and defeating Holloway for the second time. The controversial split decision
victory in favor of the Australian Volkanovski received a decent amount of

criticism with several believing the Hawaiian Holloway was robbed of a victory.
In my personal opinion, Holloway was the winner, controlling the first two to
three rounds with ease and only evidently loosing the last round which showed
Volkanovski find a second wind and successfully taking down Holloway. The
Hawaiian had the faster hands and better takedown defense successfully
defending himself against 6 of Volkanovski’s 9 takedown attempts. A third bout
seems inevitable and extremely exciting for fight fans.</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Kamaru “The Nigerian Nightmare” Usman was set to fight his teammate Gilbert
Burns for the main event of UFC-251 for his second title defense. Unfortunately
for the Brazilian Burns, he contracted the coronavirus and had to pull out.
Fortunately for all fight fans, Jorge “Gamebred” Masvidal agreed to fight the 170-
pound champ Usman on 6 days notice. Drama between both had been stirring for
almost a year with Gamebred publically calling out Usman after his 5 second KO
against Ben Askren. Gamebred made championship weight in 6 days and the
fight was officially announced to take place. It was a unanimous decision victory
and title defense for Kamaru Usman. It was evident that Masvidal was in no way
prepared to tackle the challenge that is Usman. The Nigerian Nightmare wrestled
the Florida native throughout the fight, foot stamping and digging through
Jorge’s body. In my honest opinion, Kamaru Usman is the only man who could
have made a Jorge Masvidal fight boring, with that being said I would like to say
that a rematch would be much appreciated but I cannot see it going in Masvidal’s
favor.<br>
UFC-251 was anroller coaster of emotions and an amazing experience,
throughout all the controversial decisions, exciting knockdowns and whatnot.
Dana White, the UFC and all fighters showed up, put on a show and entertained
the fans.</p>
