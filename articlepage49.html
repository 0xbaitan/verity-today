                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">If you had a billion dollars, what would you do? Get an island, start a micro-nation, or lobby congress
to outlaw healthcare? Apparently, one of the more popular choices is straight out of an “If I were a
billionaire” fantasy: real-life FIFA. It seems that an increasingly popular hobby of our ultra-rich
overlords is to sponsor their favourite sports team (or whatever team happens to catch the eye) to
the peak of the competitive landscape. Even if its not the people but rather the corporations we’re
talking about, sports just seem too attractive a marketing opportunity to pass up. </p>

                                      <img src = "articles/14.jpeg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">While billionaires playing around with sports isn’t exactly a recent phenomenon, it is one that has
gained incredible traction this decade. It arguably all starts with the early entries of Russian oligarchs
into the intensely money-centric sporting industries following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The
most famous member of this club, which includes names like Alisher Usmanov, is Roman
Abramovich, one of the world’s richest, Vladimir Putin’s BFF, and the famous owner of Chelsea FC.
Since the noughties, however, there have been atleast two waves of further investment that have
changed the sports landscape. The first was the entry of the ultra-wealthy princes and profiteers of
the Middle East, like Man City’s Sheikh Mansour or the Saudi hosts of Joshua v Ruiz. The other wave
came from the ever-present China, which has an extremely successful strategy that has taken it to
the top of not just sports but essentially every industry that accepts foreign investment. For people
as rich as the 1%, sports often fall into the same category as yachts, ultra-expensive paintings and
tax evasion: a bit of fun mucking around.<br><br>

The intentions behind these extensive investments (which amount in the hundreds of billions) are,
of course, quite impossible to predict for those of us who have to get by without slaves and gold-
plated phones. While some, such as Abramovich, who attends every game at the Stamford Bridge
and famously made 2.5 billion(!) dollars in charitable investments in the part of Russia hit hardest by
the Soviet collapse, or Mark Cuban, who has repeatedly proven a true passion for basketball and the
Dallas Mavericks, seem to have fairly above-board intentions and actually care about their sport of
choice, the same cannot be said for others. Red Bull, for example, is a very prominent name, with
their teams in both football and Formula One racing; but their interests come from a blatant
financial and public relations angle, which is in part why there has been a massive amount of anger
from fans directed at them.<br><br>

At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of theories that attempt to explain the spike in
sports investments by otherwise uninterested billionaire persons and corporations revolve around
either white-collar crime, or self-serving interests. It simply can’t be a coincidence that in the world
of “creative accounting” and soft power projection, so many of the usual suspects have decided to
pollute the world of sports.<br><br>

One possible motivation, and one that has repeatedly been suggested is what is known as
sportwashing. When problematic players like Saudi Arabia, China, and the innumerable MNCs who
happily exploit slave and child labour start buying up your favourite sports teams and players, it can
only help their public relations, establish a legitimacy for their actions. The association between your
team and its suspect owners eventually means that you’ll start supporting both, defending the
actions of the rich, the ruthless, and the right-violators as an extension of your support for that one
guy who can hit the ball good. By thus winning the war of media and publicity, billionaires,
corporations and government regimes alike can get away unnoticed (or uncared about) with horrific
violations of both laws and ethics.<br><br>

Similarly, another likely motive that keeps cropping up is, quite simply, tax evasion. Apparently big
companies aren’t satisfied with just the benefits of moving to Ireland, they also like to exploit the tax
breaks that owning Ireland’s sports professionals brings. When you (or, well, you in the future after
having killed a few kids via capitalism) buy a sports team, you can then write off most of your
purchase price against the team’s taxable income, thus enabling you to keep your vast unearned
wealth away from the grubby hands of the healthcare-loving government.<br><br>

Of course, both reasons have significant overlap. Take Qatar, for example, currently slotted to host
the 2022 World Cup. By receiving funding for stadiums and the usual infrastructure while
simultaneously using slave labour, Qatar manages to be profitable to a vast degree; simultaneously,
like Russia before it, Qatar gets the benefit of massive tourist interest and free publicity from the
world’s largest sporting event.<br><br>

All in all, there is quite some depth behind the 1%’s reasoning in taking over sports. Whether it’s
Steve Ballmer with the Clippers, or Sheikh Mansour with the City football Empire, or China’s
interests in the NBA and LeBron; if you’re wondering why they care about sports, remember, the
secret ingredient is crime.<br></p>
