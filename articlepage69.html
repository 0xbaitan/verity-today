                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one that has encompassed religious and ideological
conflicts, multiple key stakeholders, controversial sacral architecture and the inconclusive
question of the application of the Right to Self Determination all in the course of a little over
100 years. This issue traces its origins to the early beginnings of the rise of wide-scale
nationalist and religious movements in the late 19th century. Covering all these aspects in this
article would be unfathomable, hence this article will mainly focus on the question of the
legitimacy of Israel&#39;s historical claim over disputed territories and inspect a few previous
cases wherein the question has been raised. <br>
“Israel&#39;s PM Netanyahu announces post-election plan to annex West Bank”. </p>

		            				<br><p>
                                      <img src = "articles/isreal1.jpeg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></p><br>

		            			
                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">This Reuters news headline from September 2019, recently gained extensive traction,
with all major news outlets flooding their pages with reports of various statements along
these lines made by the Prime Minister of Israel on various Israeli media platforms. It was
quick to be labelled an alarming and sudden advancement in the Israeli-Palestine conflict.
The TL;DR for those of you who dismissed these reports as false campaign promises (and
perhaps rightly so) is that after years of conflict and claims over the holy land, Prime Minister
Netanyahu finally went ahead and revealed Israel&#39;s plan of annexing key disputed territory -
namely regions of the infamous West Bank, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
The annexation has been outlined in President Trump&#39;s Israel-Palestine peace plan; a plan
supposedly aimed at solving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis but one that turns a blind eye to
most Palestinian demands to the extent of not even having a Palestinian official being present
during its formation. A US-Israeli delegation is set to draw up the exact regional borders
shortly. Quite evidently, Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s statements and intentions are simply in
line with those of the P5 nuclear weapon possessing nation supporting them.
The pandemic has been a silver lining for the Palestinians as the annexation was set to be
put in action starting July; however, a pin was put in the plan for the time being. This allowed
for international forums and multiple heads of states to voice their concerns and even outright
demand that Israel drop any plans of illegal annexation prior to any escalation of the conflict.
These opinions and threats, however, have so far done nothing to make PM Benjamin
Netanyahu waver from his stance. These condemnations by the international community hold
little weight as long as Israel has the support of the United States of America- the sole or at
the very least, one of the main reasons Israel has gained the ability to be exempt from its
international commitments and has not followed Iran or North Korea in being labelled a
rogue state. <br><br>
The criticism for this move ranges from being underscored as simply a strategy for
Netanyahu to gain support from the voracious right-wingers in Israel for the upcoming
elections, being a major aggravation in the already tumultuous state of affairs in the middle
east, an illegal annexation violating various principles of international law and even it soon
becoming a major humanitarian crisis for its impact on the lives of the Palestinians.
Advocates, on the other hand, see it as a necessary move to keep the integrity of Israeli

sovereignty intact due to two major reasons. The first justification is to secure Israeli borders-
a just cause considering the various attempts at infiltration and even wars waged against
Israel by its neighbouring nations innumerable times. The sheer number of times conflict has
occurred between the same is a startling eight recognized wars, two intifadas, and a series of
armed conflicts, all within a very short duration. The second justification is that the Israeli
annexation of this territory is its authentic right based on its historical and religious claims of
the region. The belief is that the region is the “land of the Jews”, allotted to them by not only
divine sanction but also the historical basis of Britain being granted a mandate over the entire
region in 1922, and deeming it fit for the establishment of the &quot;National Home&quot; for the
Jewish people in the Balfour Declaration. All conflicts in the history of international relations
may not trace their history back to the involvement of the British in some unfavourable
capacity, but most always will. Regardless, in 1947 Britain terminated its Mandate for
Palestine and referred the matter to the United Nations wherein the UNSCOP (United
Nations Special Committee on Palestine) and even its ad-hoc committees failed to reach a
consensus regarding the decision to be made due to the multiple contrary narratives presented
to them from all parties embroiled in the conflict. <br><br>
All this leads us back to the central perplexing question of discerning between the legitimacy
of territorial claims vis-a-vis The Right to Self Determination which is the core focus of this
article as well. Territorial claims with a basis in history such as the one made by Israel has
been common in the political history of mankind. China being at the very forefront of such
territorial issues with its infamous maritime border disputes, Russia, India and various
European nations have had claims on territory based on some historical background as well.
There is a clear precedent established so far for territorial issues such as this to have remained
unresolved, even after UN or ICJ intervention. This can be seen in the Russian annexation of
Crimea and Chinas’ claims in the South China Sea region respectively. The Right to Self
Determination follows suit with the unascertained outline of any procedure by which it can
be enacted. The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) states that it
is “the right of a people to determine its own destiny. In particular, the principle allows a
people to choose its own political status and to determine its own form of economic, cultural
and social development. Exercise of this right can result in a variety of different outcomes
ranging from political independence through to full integration within a state.”. It is important
to note that the definition of “a people” in this context has remained undecided but is
customarily referred to as established minority groups. It is not the case that independent
seceded states haven’t ever been formed as otherwise can be seen in the examples of Kosovo,
Eritrea, South Sudan and a few more, however, they have seceded under the extenuating
circumstances and through external intervention or agreement by a weakened parent state.
However, multiple cases apart from the one of the Palestinians such as the crucial cases of
Catalonia, Kurdistan, Hong Kong, Balochistan, and many more have remained unaddressed
so far. It is noticeable that international bodies including the UN view secession and invoking
the Right to Self Determination as the last resort to conflict and have only been implemented
on a wide scale during dealing with the decolonisation process in the 20th century. It is only
actually implemented in other these more recent cases as can be seen in the examples of
nations cited above after multiple attempts of reconciliation through different measures and a
lot of political turmoil. However, the very idea of Self Determination is to prevent the same
turmoil hence it defeats the entire purpose if treated as a last resort option. Furthermore,
acknowledging the will of the people should not be deemed as the last resort in the first
place. <br><br>
 

On a legal and political spectrum currently, a clear answer to this convoluted issue does exist.
According to the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, territorial integrity takes precedence over the
principles of Self Determination. This is in accordance with the fact that most nations in the
world seemingly maintain following the realist theory of international relations which
includes a very similar political philosophy. However, the issue lies in the fact that choosing
to insist upon maintaining territorial sovereignty in the face of entire communities being left
feeling dissatisfied and even discriminated by those crafting their collective political identity
severely undermines the idea that international law was crafted for the purpose of the welfare
of the people. If the wishes, rights and desires of people are put secondary to maintaining a
mere territorial border, there doesn’t lie much meaning to laws, treaties and international
bodies since their very purpose was to ensure the prosperity of people and the very first
fundamental chapter of the UN charter isn’t being adhered to. The fact that people enduring
living under an identity they do not believe in is dismissed so casually is baffling considering
they usually face a high level of intolerance, discrimination or violent instability before
resorting to wishing to have their own independent statehood. There is an urgent need of the
international community to dawn upon the realisation that territory should not supersede the
rights and desires of a community and its people under any circumstances whatsoever.
Paragraph 2 of UN Resolution 1514(XV) states that &quot;all peoples have the right to self-
determination&quot; and this very ideal needs to be implemented and enforced for the will of the
people overrides all else. International bodies, Governments and all lawmakers and enforcers
in a democratic setting must recall the prevailing truth that they were created by the people
for the purpose of submitting to the will and welfare of the people and they are accountable to
the people.<br><br></p>
