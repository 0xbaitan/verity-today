pushes and then you’re falling down, down, down. What we do during
the descend is on us, and sometimes the world is left to reel from it.
There is no way but up from rock bottom, and every inspiration I ever
took from superheroes, fictional, or not have cemented this belief.
After countless series and comics on wronged civilians turned law-
enforcers (cue Batman theme song), we have grown accustomed to
fictional vigilantes, the undermined heartthrobs that turn their pain into
needed justice. But how many us are aware of the real-life models that
are out to shake the world the right way? </p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Starting with the crowd favourite, Anonymous are a decentralised
international group of cyber activists, taking anarchic actions against any
and all prominent political figures, institutions, and corporations they
deem to be in the wrong. The 2003 founded group holds true to the
motto of, “We are Anonymous. We are legion, We do not forgive. We do
not forgive. Expect us,” and have since exposed countless organisations
and their alter egos. They have evaded being ID-ed with the members’
use of the Guy Fawkes mask made infamous through the movie, V for
Vendetta and using voice distortion or speech-to-text programmes for
any audio releases. Once noted in 100 most influential people by the
Times magazine, they first came under public scrutiny by their mass
protest against the Church of Scientology. Since then, they have stepped
up their security to target larger fishes like the US and UK Government,
Al-Qaeda, KKK, and ISIS. Anonymous kept on laughing different
operations and successfully delivering the information needed to bring
down the corrupt till suddenly they vanished without a trace around late
2016. After four years of silence, the group has resurfaced to aid in the
current troubling times by shedding light on the Taiwan issue and
showing solidarity towards George Floyd. Having exposed Trump and
the Royal family for rape and sex trafficking, these cyber vigilantes have
once again managed to garner the world’s attention and support.

A classic story of bad turned good is the previously active Lulz Security,
or more commonly known as LulzSec. They started off as a bunch of
internets savvies using their skills to prank and trick online accounts.
Later, being inspired by Anonymous, they launched joint operations to
take down MNCs involved with money laundering and other suspicious
undercover activities. They had a patent statement of “Laughing at your
security since 2011,” while making public all the security flaws in
several big organizations that claimed to hold civilian records securely.
The group attacked several media houses to expose the altered news
being aired to the public and in their last act of heroism, they helped the
Federal Bureau of Investigation bust over 500 high-risk cyber crimes. 
Coming back from the cyber world, the insanely covert vigilante squad
called, The Sombra Negra, roughly translated as the Black Shadow are
legends solely for targeting the world’s most powerful criminal
enterprise. Who, you are absolutely entitled to ask. To which, I say with
a shrug, nobody except the godchild of El Salvador, Mara Salvatrucha,
otherwise referred to as MS-13. They are a death squad, allegedly
composed of police and military personnel, born in December 1989. By
their infancy stage of April 1995, they had already killed over seventeen
criminals they claimed to be mafia affiliated. Now, at their adult phase,
they have grown to tread far dangerous waters than lowlife criminals
they feel to be petty. From 2014, with the heightened gang activities
putting commoners at life risk, the gang took to actively hunting down
members of MS-13 and their rival gang, 18th Street Gang, even going so
far as to cover their resident city with posters to ask their preys to ‘leave
within five days or face certain death.’ And they have since delivered on
their promise, continuing to rack their kill count higher than ever.
We see the change. We feel the change. We breathe change. Sometimes
it’s by breaking laws that were put forth to silence a right we are owed
as humans, and sometimes it’s because we are tired, exhausted,
frustrated with the promises made to us with a sincerity that only lasted
till we held on to the power. But the moment our fingers let go, those
pleas of a better tomorrow vanished as raindrops left too long. 
Plato left the world with a message – <br>“The price good men pay for
indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.”</p>

                                    <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">So what about

those who are tired of sitting back silently to let their homes burn? Are
they evil to have broken the laws of society to usurp the undeserved
head or are they justified in their attempt to take down the bad, even at
the cost of themselves?</p>
