                    The women’s liberation movement was a heterogeneous social
                    movement which worked towards the accomplishment of gender
                    equality. It started in the late 1960s and continued till
                    the 1980s. This movement shook the strong pillars of
                    validated patriarchy and social hierarchies deeply rooted in
                    the grounds of the society confining the physical
                    independence and individuality of women.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    After an intense fight for women’s right to vote in the 19th
                    century, feminists all over the world presented a strong
                    front against discrimination; at the same time women
                    activists were hosting campaigns and leading movements to
                    inform the women about their responsibility and importance
                    as new voters. Organizations such as the League of Women
                    Voters and the Women’s Institute worked towards this cause.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    With women being treated as second-class citizens, their
                    participation and contribution in historic events were
                    completely excluded from the academic syllabus in schools.
                    Therefore, to understand the bigger picture of how women
                    have been no less courageous than men, the WLM groups
                    launched study programs which included feminist history,
                    sociology and psychology as well as adult education to
                    counter the gender biases in reading these texts.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The WLM did not only stand against sexism but also fought
                    racism, homophobia and stood in solidarity with any
                    individual or group affected by other forms of oppression.

                    The WLM was successful in many ways such as in criminalizing
                    violence in a marriage which was legal in UK till 1991, the
                    Abortion Art 1967 was a landmark for the women’s
                    reproductive rights which is even now a constant threat in
                    many countries. The small milestones of the group were to
                    help girls be confident in their own skin and not pay heed
                    to societal standards of beauty. In the late 1980s, during
                    the HIV/AIDS crisis which primarily focused on the LGBTQ
                    community, they made sure that the impact on women were not

                    On the Basis of Sex, a 2018 biographical legal drama
                    directed by Mimi Leder, is a film based on the Late Supreme
                    Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s life and her path to
                    become the leading gender rights lawyer of her time. The
                    film follows her early life of studying in Harvard and
                    during the unfortunate disease of her husband: how she took
                    care of him, and, at the same time, attended his classes,
                    returning home and nurturing their infant daughter Jane, her
                    transfer to Columbia and graduating at the top of her class.
                    Due to difficulties in landing a job as a lawyer in any firm
                    because of her gender, she takes up a job at the Rutgers Law
                    College teaching ‘sex discrimination and the law’.

                    Felicity Jones delivers a strong and exceptional performance
                    as RBG. The cinematic scenes of Ruth’s research for the case
                    shows her passion and love for the law. It is indeed an
                    important story to be shared, for it speaks about a woman
                    who changed how law was practiced and wasn’t willing to give
                    up without a proper fight.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Suffragette is a 2015 British historical drama film Directed
                    by Sarah Gavron is about a group of working women who joined
                    hands and fought for the women’s suffrage movement in the
                    United Kingdom: they were sent to prison and beaten up,
                    fired and died for it. Maud Watts’s life changes after she
                    is caught in a suffragette protest - she was not allowed to
                    see her son and was thrown out by her husband which only
                    prompted her towards reformism in the favor of women’s
                    rights. The movie ends with clips showing various countries
                    giving women the right to vote. It shows the means by which
                    women have organized and gained attention for their rights,
                    from campaigning from hunger strikes in prison to bombing
                    pillar boxes. The film represents real life activists, with
                    several characters based on them.

                    The Glorias is a 2020 American biographical drama directed
                    by Julie Taymor. It’s a movie on the multiple life stages of
                    Gloria Steinem, who has lived such a significant and
                    honorable life that four actresses were casted to play her,
                    among whom were two Oscar winners. Gloria Steinem is a fine
                    woman who is a feminist icon to most people and someone who
                    chose not to get involved with a man and settle down in a
                    time where women were always expected to get married and
                    have children.

                    The movie is not the same as the traditional biopics; it
                    doesn't begin with Steinem's life's chronological events but
                    keeps bouncing backward and forward to different parts of
                    her life. The film traces her extraordinary life as she
                    actively participates in the women's liberation movement and
                    her role as a leading figure in the '60s, '70s and the '80s;
                    it also depicts some of the most important historic events
                    such as the 1977 National Women's Conference and the launch
                    of Ms., America's first feminist magazine. Women around the
                    world have acknowledged this movie as a source of learning
                    more about Gloria's activism and are very much grateful for
                    her contributions in making a better place for them to live
                    in.

                    North Country is a 2005 American drama directed by Niki
                    Caro. It is a movie based on the true story of a mine
                    labourer, Lois Jenson. Here, she flees from her abusive
                    husband and returns to her hometown where she lands a job at
                    an iron mine. She finds that the women in her workplace were
                    constant targets of sexual harassment by most male
                    co-workers who believed that women were not fit for these
                    jobs. After being assaulted, she, with the support of a
                    friend, files a suit against the company and the union after
                    they did not provide any solutions for her situation of
                    unchecked humiliation and intimidation, while the other
                    women refused to stand with her since they felt their jobs
                    were at threat. Jenson was the first woman who won a sex
                    discrimination case in the United States, setting a powerful
                    precedent for the future. The movie brings us realistic
                    depictions of the discomfort women have to face at a
                    workplace that is dominated by men and at the same time have
                    to tolerate constant nagging and mockery.

                    The Women’s Liberation Movement was recognized as a branch
