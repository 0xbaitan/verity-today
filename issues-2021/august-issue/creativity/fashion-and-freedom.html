                    These words by Jawaharlal Nehru will forever be etched in
                    every Indian’s heart. They incite goosebumps every time they
                    fall upon our ears. They tell the tale of a country that
                    resisted well and fought a successful battle with one common
                    goal in mind – taking back what was rightfully its own.

                    15th August 2021 marks India’s 75th Independence Day. It has
                    been quite the journey, and the roots of our country remain
                    unshaken, with unity thriving even in diversity. We’re no
                    strangers to the fact that as with every other rule, the
                    British Raj stirred up a lot of changes in the ways of our
                    people. One of the most significant transformations though
                    was the perception of clothing. Before colonization, Indian
                    fashion was based primarily on weather conditions, and the
                    clothing was aligned with ‘convenience’ more than anything
                    else. But later, instead of evolving into just creative
                    expression, Indian fashion gave in to the ways of the
                    English. This transformation, instead of being a direct
                    effect of colonization, stemmed from the strategy of ‘Divide
                    & Rule.’ Indian wardrobes welcomed European fashion by will,
                    by force, or by significance. We all know the stories of how
                    the people who approved of the Goras’ dress code and
                    etiquettes instantly received better treatment than the ones
                    who resisted and called it outrageous. Those who fell in the
                    ‘elite’ category were exempted from atrocities faced by the
                    others. Slowly, the people started retaliating under the
                    leadership of various figures. But what were the elements
                    that defined Indian attire during the Raj? What stayed, and
                    was there anything that left with the English? Here, we let
                    our curiosity take the front seat and delve into Pre & Post
                    Independence fashion in India.

                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    For most of us, history lessons in school comprised images
                    from worlds we couldn’t familiarise ourselves with, and
                    pictures of sculptures & paintings depicting age-old Indian
                    dressing. Blouses and petticoats once were an alien concept,
                    even though cholis and lehengas existed among other stitched
                    pieces. A high percentage of women wore a drape of
                    white-colored, yards-long cloth called the saree, and it was
                    integral to battling hot & humid weather conditions. The
                    entry of the Britishers brought with it an upturned smile
                    about the layers that were lacking in the saree. The rulers
                    found it offensive to wear a saree without a blouse or a
                    petticoat, thus infusing it with European influences.
                    Fast-forward to the years following 1947, blouses and
                    petticoats made a permanent home for themselves in every
                    wardrobe. Even today, one isn’t complete without the other
                    when it comes to the traditional saree. With western culture
                    much more prominent in the decolonized, well-traveled, and
                    evolved India, we love how the same saree continues to see
                    several renditions that everyone adores. Indian cinema, even
                    when it loved western trends, never forgot the significance
                    of the saree. Pieces like denim, shirts, skirts, etc. slowly
                    found a spot in young womens’ wardrobes, but sarees were
                    still a treasure and will always be.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Indians were most definitely picking up on the various ways
                    that the English chose to dress up. Don’t we all have that
                    one beautiful brooch that we’ve seen in our mothers’ and
                    grandmothers’ bauble box? Whether it is already passed on to
                    us or not, it does make us wonder what pushed the older
                    generations into pinning up their saree or dupattas with
                    these brooches, instead of using the ordinary pin. Their
                    introduction into Indian jewels can be attributed to
                    European fashion trends. Indian women would see the
                    Memsahibs finish off their looks with stunning pins, as they
                    were all the rage in England at the time.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Dhoti-Kurta was the traditional and humble way of dressing
                    for Indian men. Due to broad classifications and a large
                    number of people following the same dressing style, several
                    men adapted the shirt-trouser styles that the Sahibs wore.
                    Indian Kings were extremely fond of the British dress code,
                    as were some of the commoners. When it came to the others,
                    wearing shirts and suiting up meant that they’d be favored
                    and thought that it signified literacy since clothing became
                    a symbol of the position one held in the society.

                    anymore. Bollywood played a massive role in infusing Indian
                    fashion with western influences. The films made them famous,
                    but that doesn’t mean Indian men forgot their humble ways of
                    dressing. They were still depicted with kurtas and dhotis,

                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The government and activists are encouraging present-day
                    India to turn to locally-made products in every sector. This
                    could open up a lot of opportunities for our people. It’d
                    also lessen the need to look elsewhere for work or get work
                    done. ‘Self-sufficient’ is a word that we must strive to
                    live by as much as we can. But if we look back towards the
                    days of the Raj, we’ll see the movement being led by
                    Gandhiji. Its purpose was much larger and very impactful.
                    The movement used clothing as a means to send a message to
                    the colonizers and the colonized. It was Gandhi’s
                    Khadi-Swaraj movement is notable in every way. Khadi was a
                    fabric that screamed ‘unity’. It aimed at abolishing
                    societal issues like untouchability, while trying to bridge
                    the gap between the rich & the poor. Khadi was everyone’s
                    fabric; everyone who wanted to see an India that was free,
                    self-sufficient, and was on the road to reviving the Indian
                    economy. He encouraged everyone to take to the charkha and
                    weave every day. Economic independence & equality were the
                    ultimate goals of the khaddar weave. The once significantly
                    political fabric is now a symbol of Indian-ness over the
                    world. Designers aren’t only working towards a full-fledged
                    revival of this intellectual fabric but also making it
                    stylish for the youth. The coarse texture that it once bore
                    has evolved into smoother, airier weaves. Khadi is a huge
                    part of the ethical fashion movement. For Indians though, it
                    isn’t just a fabric that employed many or signifies
                    resistance – it’s our pride.

                    Fashion has always been a considerable part of India’s
                    history. Given a choice, we know we would always pick
                    authentic Indian silhouettes over anything else. We like to
                    define the words ‘pride of India’ as pieces that survived it
                    all. The people of our nation found a voice through
                    clothing. That is why, no matter the modifications, they
                    will always remain unapologetically Indian, in our eyes –
                    and in those of the world.
