                    ‘These are the times that try men’s souls’ begins Thomas
                    Paine in his pamphlet, ‘Common Sense’ released in early
                    1776, in which he details all the reasons as to why the 13
                    British colonies deserve the right to self-govern and by
                    extent, gain independence from the overbearing British
                    monarchy. The success of the American revolution inspired
                    countries around the globe to fight monarchy and tyranny and
                    was the first time the British monarchy had been challenged
                    and subsequently defeated. The American Revolution was
                    hardly only an American effort - the battle of Yorktown,
                    which was the last land war of the Revolution, was
                    effectively won by the Americans because of the French
                    intervention, led by Lafayette. This is an isolated example,
                    instances of such interventions exist in plenty. That is not
                    to say that loyalists to the British Crown did not exist -
                    about 20% of the white population belonged to the category.
                    Much of the enslaved population and the Indigenous
                    population too supported the British cause and
                    understandably so. On the other hand, the majority of the
                    white population were patriots and ‘Common Sense’ was a
                    major reason why.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    ‘Common Sense’ was released in January 1776, amid the
                    American Revolution, merely a few months before America
                    gained its independence. The catalyst to its huge success
                    could be attributed to the fact that the pamphlet was
                    extremely accessible. It was about 47 pages long and was
                    written in a language that could connect to people of all
                    social statuses. ‘Common Sense’ did not present
                    philosophical abstractions and metaphors, instead, it harped
                    on personal experiences and emotions. Thomas Paine
                    channelled his own experiences, as he came from a humble
                    background. This did a marvellous job in helping common
                    people recognize themselves in the argument and, therefore,
                    helping them adopt the ideals of the patriots - the need for
                    a free America. A free America, and emphasis on this one,
                    concerning white people.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    ‘Common Sense’ sold about 500,000 copies during the
                    Revolutionary War. It was read out loud at almost every
                    meeting organized by the patriots; pirated copies of the
                    pamphlet were in circulation throughout the colonies. In a
                    letter, George Washington once wrote to a friend, applauding
                    the impact ‘Common Sense’ had on the common American and how
                    it inspired people who already felt resistance to act on it.
                    Thomas Paine provided the common people with the confidence
                    they needed. For the first time, somebody was openly
                    criticizing the monarchy and was confident in the fact that
                    the Continental Army would be able to defeat the British
                    army, which was a global superpower. ‘Common Sense’ presents
                    the revolution as what it was - achievable and largely
                    inevitable.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The pamphlet heavily criticizes the English constitution,
                    especially the role of the monarch. He calls the English
                    constitution contradictory and against the will of God. He
                    criticizes the role of the monarch, the sheer existence of
                    one, and concludes that the so-called representative of God
                    on earth and their role itself defied the Scriptures. Paine
                    writes of how their connections to Great Britain will only
                    hold them back, how, despite reasoning that the British
                    Colonies would be safer under the rule of the Crown, when
                    questioned by the patriots, they still didn’t put the
                    wellbeing of the people of the Colonies over their profits.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    ‘Common Sense’ is written in an inspiring and confident
                    tone. In this case, it targeted the freedom of a place that
                    was already on the brink of revolution. However, at the end
                    of the day, most people of the British Colonies still were
                    not convinced. After all, how could a ragtag army of
                    volunteers defeat a global superpower? Paine harped on the
                    fact that their victory was not only possible but also
                    inevitable. French and Spanish reinforcements were already
                    on their way, and together with this, the usual casualness
                    and utter confidence the entire pamphlet had was able to
                    convince almost everyone to have faith in the revolution. As
                    a piece of propaganda, ‘Common Sense’ worked marvellously
                    well.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The pamphlet also spoke of the kind of government America
                    would be governed under, after they achieved their long-due
                    independence. Paine stressed the importance of American
                    freedom and most importantly, their ability to be able to
                    self-govern. Paine pushed on the existence of a strong
                    central government that would protect the rights, freedoms,
                    and beliefs of the people. ‘Common Sense’ painted the
                    picture of a free America, at a time, most were scared to
                    even imagine it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    America went on to achieve its independence and managed to
                    abolish the same crimes, they didn’t even consider crimes at
                    the time they fought for their independence. ‘Common Sense’,
                    after all these centuries, still stands tall and true. Its
                    impact on the events of history, and its genius are still
                    worthy of being praised.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In ‘’Common Sense’ Thomas Paine writes, ‘We have it in power
                    to begin the world over again’ and between all the bleeding
                    and fighting, the reading and writing, ‘Common Sense’
                    achieved that in its entirety.
