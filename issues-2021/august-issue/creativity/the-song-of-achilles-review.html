                    Miller really hit the jackpot with this one. The book took a
                    whopping 10 years of her life, and, trust me when I say
                    this, the book felt like something she had been working
                    towards her entire life, only to be recognized after her
                    premature-multitalented-artist death - easily her Magnum
                    Opus, her zenith. It was a zenith high enough to last her
                    seven lifetimes of fame, and, although I hate to say this,
                    esoteric fame. I can only account for how much the ignorant
                    ones are missing out on. Well, guess what? It was her debut
                    novel. A little jaw dropping to say the least.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Set in ancient Greece, it covers everything from the birth
                    of Achilles, to his death in the Trojan War. I am sure you
                    have heard multiple accounts of the exploits of the ever so
                    legendary Achilles and how he single-handedly paved the way
                    for the fall of the so famed impregnable city of Troy. You
                    have heard of his skyscraping hubris, his immortality and
                    his skills in the art of wielding weapons for the purpose of
                    claiming brainwashed lives. You have heard of his honor and
                    everything he staked on that single word. What then, makes
                    this book so special? What makes this rendition of the same
                    story over and over again stand out? Let’s break it down.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    1)&emsp;You know how it is a little difficult to follow the
                    ancient language used in Shakespearean literature and that
                    used in epics, and how in the process of trying to decipher
                    what the author is actually trying to get at, you lose the
                    emotions that lace the narrative? I suppose most of us
                    modern readers relate to that. It honestly feels like you
                    have been handed the blueprints of an enormous mansion and
                    asked to identify secret passages throughout it. No matter
                    how seasoned the multitasker in you is, it’s a little bit of
                    an ordeal trying to feel the writing in your blood when you
                    are busy trying to feel it in your brain. This book, on the
                    other hand, was designed with the modern reader in mind. A
                    rendition of an ancient story, only more spiced up and
                    easier to understand? Sounds perfect to me.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    2)&emsp;It is the perfect size - It has 416 pages and isn’t
                    very time consuming at all! You won’t have to go hunting for
                    all 24 parts of the Iliad to know the highlights of the
                    story!
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    3)&emsp;It is affordable, priced at INR 599 and is available
                    in most bookstores including online ones!
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    4)&emsp;Miller, of course, added a few twists to the story
                    for the modern reader. This book adds dimensions to who we
                    simply know as a glorified, immortal, unbeatable-in-combat,
                    conceited killing machine. It paints him in the light of a
                    lover, a father and a son. You will just have to take my
                    word for it when I say that this gave birth to one of the
                    most powerful, passion-laden love stories of the age, the
                    love that flowed stronger than electricity between Patroclus
                    - an exile who was fostered in the Kingdom of Phthia, ruled
                    by Peleus, Achilles’ father - and Achilles. We see a side of
                    Achilles never seen before, and we also see Achilles through
                    the eyes of Patroclus, which is indubitably the most
                    beautiful thing in the world. There might be spoilers ahead,
                    so I suggest, if you haven’t read the book, you skip the
                    rest of this point. I mean, when was the last time someone
                    thought about their lover in the lines, “Will I feel his
                    ashes as they fall against mine” (a line said by Patroclus
                    in the book). Patroclus represents the compassionate side of
                    Achilles, the human, mortal side: the side which shows us
                    how much Achilles actually had to lose when he made the
                    decision to go to war against Troy, because if you know the
                    story, there was a prophecy that warned him that he would
                    never return from Troy if he made the decision to go. He
                    knew he was, quite in its literal and metaphorical sense,
                    walking into his coffin. Patroclus was the only human being
                    that Achilles would go to hell and back for, and it only
                    existed in extremes. The others, he could not care less for,
                    and there was no in-between. Patroclus was Achilles’
                    strength and Achilles’ weakness. It is quite tragic to see
                    how Patroclus is the one who still ends up dying first,
                    despite preparing for his lover to die first and doing
                    everything in his power to grab the extra second with
                    Achilles while he was still alive.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A word comes to mind as I say this, “Ya’aburnee”, an Arabic
                    word which is used to declare the hope that one’s lover
                    would die first because of how unbearable it would be to
                    live without them. No book has ever made me feel as deeply
                    as this and I hope you have the same thing to say about it
                    once you are done reading it.

                    If you are the dramatic type, like me, then let me serenade
                    the memorial of this book with following lines from the song
                    Till Forever Falls Apart by Ashlyn and Finneas:

                    And if the sky falls from heaven above<br />
