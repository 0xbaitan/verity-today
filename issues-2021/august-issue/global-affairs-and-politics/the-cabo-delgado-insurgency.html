                    ISIS strongholds are slowly resurrecting in Mozambique with
                    brutal massacres already at play; how do you prevent the

                    its full infamy?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Cabo Delgado was once the centre of liberation from the
                    colonial occupation, and now it faces another crucial
                    conflict. Since 2017, groups of fighters, often carrying
                    ISIS flags and denouncing the state and the Frelimo ruling
                    party, have grown from small units targeting remote security
                    posts into heavily equipped militants that threaten national
                    stability and international peace. The ISIL-linked fighters
                    in Mozambique have racked up immense chaos with mass
                    abductions, beheadings and destruction of infrastructure in
                    towns, and are even expanding their operations into
                    Tanzania. They’ve also taken control over a key port town in
                    Mozambique. This has displaced some 700,000 people and
                    killed more than 2,500. The most horrifying incident was of
                    50 people being beheaded in a sports field over the course
                    of a weekend. Security sources report that these militants
                    have developed cells not just among the civilian population
                    but also within armed force units.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Factors that made the region a centre for conflict include
                    poverty, destruction of people’s livelihoods (mainly mining
                    of ruby deposits), the rise of local criminals enforcing
                    Islamist ideologies, and colonial-era tensions between the
                    Mwani and Makua peoples. The socio-economic inequalities
                    faced by Mwani against the dominance of the Makonde elites
                    after independence cause them to remain sympathetic to the
                    opposition- RENAMO. All of this internal strife and unrest
                    was never conclusively handled, and it has since snowballed
                    and turned into the crisis we know now.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Officials in the Mozambican government initially dismissed
                    the matter and referred to the group as local criminals;
                    this has since changed to labelling them as terrorists, and
                    in so doing, they have admitted the problem is greater than
                    initially thought. However, this classification implies that
                    terrorist groups are the only ones behind the threat.
                    Islamist militants from Tanzania are among the militants’
                    leaders, but the majority of the group’s members are
                    Mozambicans - disenfranchised, unemployed and frustrated
                    youth. Their motivations for joining the group are less
                    shaped by ideology than by frustration against the
                    government. They are slowly turning into committed jihadists
                    from frustrated revolters as their interaction with
                    terrorists continues.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Along with this, Amnesty International accused both the
                    fighters and Mozambique’s security forces, as well as a
                    South African private military firm hired by the government,
                    of war crimes against civilians, including extrajudicial
                    executions and acts of torture. This makes all parties in
                    this conflict guilty and blurs the lines between the
                    perpetrators and victims.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Mozambique’s army is currently incapable of handling this
                    threat as their forces are already stretched out thin
                    handling the security of the country and the surrender of a
                    residual armed faction of the Renamo opposition group. The
                    navy, meanwhile, is barely functioning. The elite
                    paramilitary was able to stop the militants’ advance and
                    destroyed some of their camps but was unable to neutralise
                    them. Mozambique’s government needs foreign partners to
                    provide the resources, including lethal assistance.
                    Mozambique’s Western partners are concerned about the
                    reports of abuses committed against the population by
                    security forces and potential leaks of government weapons
                    into militants’ hands. Hence, private military contractors
                    have secretly been operating- Russian mercenaries from the
                    Wagner group and the South Africa-based Dyck Advisory Group
                    (DAG) were believed to have been invited. The Mozambican
                    government has invited US military advisers to train local
                    forces fighting the militants. However, it seems the US is
                    framing the insurgency in a very oversimplified manner by
                    referring to the militants as an extension of the Islamic
                    State solely. The Southern African Development Community
                    (SADC) is also seeking to build international support to
                    deploy its own troops into Mozambique. But, Filipe Nyusi -
                    the president - has been nervous about that happening. His
                    critics say he wants to keep prying eyes out of the
                    province, a zone for illicit activity including heroin
                    trafficking. His supporters emphasise rather that he is just
                    being careful about what kind of intervention he allows,
                    wary that a heavy presence of foreign troops could become
                    difficult to control.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Any external intervention should be measured so that it can
                    both respond to the security threat posed by the militants
                    and also protect civilians on their return. Mozambique
                    should direct international assistance to support and train
                    its own special forces and conduct restricted military
                    operations against al-Shabab. Patrolling territorial waters
                    could also deny militants opportunities to move fighters and
                    supplies. Mozambique’s forces should focus on providing
                    security around the areas that natives were forced to flee
                    from and aid their return. Nyusi should start dialogues with
                    civilians to soothe local tensions and rebuild trust with
                    communities that feel let down by the state. Such dialogue
                    might also help authorities open lines of communication with
                    the militants.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The modus operandi of ISIS is well recorded - preying on the
                    existing conflict areas or weakened states by recruiting
                    disillusioned and disenfranchised members that are on the
                    precipice of revolting violently against the government.
                    These people readily accept extremist help in order to call
                    upon the government to accede to their demands and gain
                    local control, later falling prey and getting recruited.
                    That's exactly what is occurring in Mozambique as well. One
                    can try to defeat ISIS by calling upon all kinds of
                    unsanctioned foreign military help but it will never be
                    enough without pacifying the existing internal unrest that
                    fuels their growth. Good governance is the unparalleled
                    answer to such conflicts.
