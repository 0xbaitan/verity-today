                    Sometime or another in our life, we all rely on Taylor Swift
                    to help us bail out of a toxic relationship. Becoming the
                    reprimand of every bad friendship ever was her famous lyric
                    “band-aids don’t fix bullet holes”. Even non-romantic
                    breakups are horrible because we go into a relationship
                    thinking this person will be my rock and have my back. Yes,
                    every human relationship has drama, fights, and
                    misunderstandings but if they leave you stressed, angry or
                    sad every time and if it’s a straight yes- opting out of the
                    relationship is much better, as harsh as it sounds: “You are
                    allowed to like your friends. But if you don’t like your
                    friends… get new ones”. But only if dumping someone in a
                    relationship was as simple as a KonMari cleanse on your
                    social media list. They say it takes two to tango, there is
                    no toxic person but rather, the dynamic of two people ends
                    up becoming toxic and harmful for your mental health.
                    Sometimes people just don’t fit together, but it’s hard to
                    point out if it's simple human mistakes and miscommunication
                    or a relationship that you need to distance yourself from.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A whole bunch of drama, chaos seems to follow toxic
                    friendships: they are always arguing with someone, causing
                    issues and unbelievable things keep happening to them. They
                    make everything about them. According to them, everything
                    revolves around them. They manipulate the conversation that
                    you start so that it's back to them regardless of the topic.
                    A toxic person will barely ever compliment you. They’ll
                    never pick on you but never congratulate you either. You
                    have an idea, they’ll say it’s not sensible or dismiss it;
                    they keep telling you, whenever you tell them something,
                    that it’s not good enough and they are likely to kick you
                    when you’re down. It’ll feel as if you aren’t ever happy
                    talking to them, like you can’t be yourself around them
                    because they’ll judge you. They don’t just put you down but
                    also act hypocritical. They won’t ever feel bad for putting
                    you down just because they are dramatic and irrational. You
                    just have to let them get away with what they did because
                    you don’t want to ruin the friendship and set them off. And
                    if it's anything like this the best advice is to distance
                    yourself and work on yourself. A toxic relationship like
                    this will have you be socially distanced, cause anxiety,
                    lower your self- esteem and confidence.

                    “Because we are so consumed by a toxic relationship, we may
                    have distanced ourselves from others who could have been
                    close and kind. In order to have the strength to have a
                    ‘break-up’ conversation, I usually recommend working towards
                    forming more genuine, healthy bonds with other friends in
                    order to feel supported.” - Rhea Gandhi.

                    In the end, when you realise that it's toxic and harming
                    you, cutting off ties almost seems nightmarish. Because
                    positive change is sometimes scary, holding on seems to be
                    the better idea, but, at the end of the day, it’s not,
                    because they affect you so much more than you realise. So,
                    take it day by day. It starts with believing in yourself,
                    because in a toxic relationship, the person has made you
                    believe that what they say is the best. They dictate our
                    perceptions of the world and of ourselves, making it match
                    theirs, and destroy our perspectives. In a manipulative
                    relationship, people often tend to take your truths, and
                    stories, twist them to incorporate small lies in them and
                    make you believe that their version is true. Believing in
                    yourself and building up your confidence again is essential.
                    Then move forward with setting boundaries and personal
                    space. If they always make you live in constant fear, like
                    you are scared to not reply to their texts or calls,
                    remember it’s your life, they hold nothing over you and
                    can’t control you.
                  </p>

                    “It’s okay to not be available all the time, not text back
                    immediately or generally feel responsible for them. No
                    healthy relationship demands that of you,” says Hingorani.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And then it goes on with suggesting a break from the
                    friendship. It removes the idea of cutting off the ties
                    completely. Taking time for yourself, getting breathing
                    space and re-evaluating your choices with a fresh mind is
                    the way to go. And, after that, if you feel any toxicity in
                    the dyname, you will have much more strength to cut off
                    ties. If you believe that cutting off ties with this person
                    will lead to you being judged and they will end up hating
                    you, remember that you will be judged one way or the other,
                    so why not do yourself a favour and let your haters judge
                    your success and have your positive support system have your
                    backs and be your rock. Someday you will find the Monica to
                    your Rachel, but right now it’s important to remove all the
                    negativity from your life and live it the best you can, and
                    along the way life will give you the best moments and people
                    that you will connect to like the FRIENDs’ iconic cast or
                    your iconic relationship, friendship duo!

                    Hey everyone, I am Anayaa Agarwal and my pronouns are
                    she/her. I am a 14 year old who, on a rainy cloud day, or at
                    2 am in the morning, can be found listening to music,
                    sketching or reading. I would like to think of myself as a
                    kind and easily approachable person, who is slightly weird
                    :/. My absolute favourite subjects are biology, english and
                    art. My other favourites include dancing, and organising
                    things. I love to write, mostly about what's on my mind.
