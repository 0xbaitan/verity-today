                    Depression is such a taboo topic in various communities.
                    However, diving deeper, teen or adolescent depression is
                    overlooked even more. The main reason behind it is that
                    adults usually view teenagers lashing out as a sign of
                    hormonal havoc. Depression influences more than a person's
                    disposition. It affects thinking, too. It meddles with the
                    ability to notice or enjoy the good things in life. There
                    are so many symptoms of depression and they need to be
                    diagnosed in order to treat them.

                    Teenagers are more prone to experience negative feelings
                    than adults. They may feel hopeless and doubt their self
                    worth. Feelings which might seem innocuous to others might
                    be serious for teenagers who show symptoms of depression.
                    They also start doubting everything that they do and lose
                    their confidence. They have private thoughts which make
                    their lives difficult.

                    one pernickety. Negative thinking invades their mind and
                    makes them believe that they wonâ€™t get through their rough
                    phase. These thoughts might make them feel repulsive and

                    If teenagers are exposed to physical, mental or sexual abuse
                    then it can be detrimental for their mental health.
                    Teenagers may become vulnerable to depression if they are

                    When these chemicals are abnormal or impaired, the function

                    Therapy is the tritest method to treat depression among
                    which the frequently used methods are cognitive behavioral
                    therapy, interpersonal therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.
                    Medications are also involved in the treatment of
                    depression. A combination of both therapy and medications
                    can be extremely effective among teens who are suffering
                    from depression. If a teenager shows lethal signs of self
                    harm then he/she must be admitted to the hospital.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sanctioned the
                    following 2 medicines for teen depression â€” fluoxetine
                    (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro).

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Although most antidepressants are innocuous, the FDA
                    requires all the antidepressants to contain a warning. In
                    certain cases teenagers even have an increase in suicidal
                    thoughts in the first week of taking the medication.
                    However, in most cases taking antidepressants with a
                    doctorâ€™s approval is highly effective among adolescents
                    experiencing depression. Antidepressants, in the long run,
                    reduce the risk of self-harm or suicide. However, one needs
                    to keep in mind that everyone is disparate and it might take
                    some time to choose the correct medication for teenagers.
                    Medicines need to be carefully monitored considering
                    overdose can be noxious to one. If your teen has pestering
                    side effects, he or she shouldn't stop taking an
                    antidepressant.

                    &bullet; Parents need to make sure that teenagers attend the
                    appointments and consume the prescribed medications even if
                    they are reluctant to do so. Pangs of anxiety or depression
                    may relapse in case teenagers stop sticking to the treatment
                    plan.<br /><br />
                    &bullet; Educating themselves on depression may not only
                    help parents become closer to their teens but also help them
                    identify their struggles. Teenagers should also educate
                    themselves on various mental health topics so that they can
                    communicate effortlessly with their closed ones.<br /><br />
                    &bullet; Having an open conversation with teens might help
                    them feel comfortable around their parents. They will open
                    up about their struggles with more ease.<br /><br />
                    &bullet; It is extremely important for parents to pay heed
                    to the warning signs of depression. If teenagers are being
                    vocal about their struggles, they should not dismiss them as
                    mere hormonal havoc.<br /><br />
                    &bullet; Teenagers, as well as parents, should educate
                    themselves on the deleterious repercussions of drugs.
                    Parents should ensure that their teens learn the various
                    harmful consequences of taking drugs and have a healthy
                    conversation on this topic with them.<br /><br />

                    Blurb: Hello everyone! My name is Sayani Kar and I am a 17
                    year old student currently residing in India. My pronouns
                    are she/her. I always had a passion for writing and wanted
                    to explore my passion. Therefore, I ended up getting a spot
                    as a content writer at Verity Today. My other hobbies
                    include dancing and script writing. Looking forward to
                    making some more memories with the organization and my
                    fellow readers.
