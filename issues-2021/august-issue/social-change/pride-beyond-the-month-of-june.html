                    The Stonewall uprising, also famous as the Stonewall riots
                    began when on the 28th June’69 the NYU city police raided a
                    gay bar in Greenwich Village, New York The Stonewall Inn,
                    which enraged several riots comprising of the bar advocators
                    and residents from the quarter playing a major role in this
                    activism, leading to a six-day protest outside the bar on
                    Christopher Street and also brought out people from various
                    corners of the world in support of such a necessary
                    revolutionary movement. The first pride walk was a riot and
                    it also marks the anniversary of the stonewall uprising and
                    has been one of the many traditions henceforward.

                    In India, the landmark event in the history of the LGBTQIA+
                    community was in 2016 when five people filed a writ petition
                    in Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of
                    Section 377 of IPC and alleging it as a direct violation of
                    the fundamental rights. The petition was first presented to
                    the former CJI Justice S.A.Bobde and Justice A.K.Bhusan on
                    29th June’19. The case Navtej Singh Johar and other VS Union
                    of India was heard in a five-bench seating starting from
                    17th Jan’18 to 20th July’18. On 6th September the court
                    found that criminalising homosexuality would deliberately
                    violate the fundamental right of equality therefore it was
                    declared unconstitutional.

                    Often women are told that it is a normal thing, it should
                    This brief idea of how the LGBTQIA+ community was given
                    equal rights and liberty tells us about the long diligent
                    measures and stances the spectrum had to take for an overdue
                    recognition in the society, for being accepted for their
                    sexual preferences and living a dignified life.

                    practice of gay conversion therapy and curative rape.

                    Right-wing religious groups believe that an individual’s
                    sexual orientation can be ‘corrected’ through prayers or
                    other forms of religious efforts, or through so-called gay
                    conversion therapy. Gay conversion therapy is used to
                    suppress the homosexuality of an individual or from living
                    as a different gender than the one assigned at birth. Even
                    though the practice is discredited by WHO and 50 other
                    health professional associations but due to discrimination
                    and societal bias against the spectrum it is practised by
                    several others in the profession. Only six countries –
                    Brazil, Ecuador, Germany and Malta have been found to ban
                    the usage of such practice in a survey conducted by ILGA
                    WORLD while another four countries- the US, Canada,
                    Australia, and Spain have laws preventing the practice in
                    some wings of their countries. In India, we do not have a
                    separate law banning conversion therapy but has
                    decriminalised it along with recognising that it is not a
                    mental disorder that needs treatment to ‘fix it and even
                    though the Mental Care Act of 2017 can be used to grant
                    limited protection but it does not compensate for the need a
                    separate law for addressing this issue. Conversion therapy
                    harms mental health and can lead to depression, drug use and
                    self-harm especially in the case of minors.

                    However, homophobic rape which is a part of conversion
                    therapy is practised more often wherein the parents get
                    their child raped in order to ‘fix’ their sexuality or guide
                    them to the ‘right path of heterosexuality’. According to a
                    report of the Crisis Invention team in Telangana in between
                    2010-15 there are fifteen cases of homophobic rape reported
                    and at the same time there are many more cases but they are
                    not reported hence the count isn’t accurate. Some personal
                    experiences of the survivors including men stating that this
                    was done to teach them ‘a lesson’ while for women it was to
                    show the ‘what exactly were they missing out’ while in
                    reality, the impact on their sexuality was absolutely zero
                    while their health condition both physically and mentally
                    drained to a larger extent. Homophobic rape was known to be
                    a cure so it was named curative rape, or corrective rape,
                    while it does nothing to influence the sexuality it leaves
                    the survivor with physiological trauma, unwanted pregnancy,
                    and drives them towards self-harm and suicide.

                    While conversion therapy and homophobic rape are tormenting
                    coming from the family, the outside world has not been
                    kinder to the spectrum either. According to Wikipedia,
                    ‘Queerbaiting is a marketing technique for fiction and
                    entertainment in which creators hint at, but then do not
                    actually depict, same-sex romance or other LGBTQIA+
                    representatives. This is strictly done with the intention to
                    gain more audience from the spectrum and attract a
                    heterosexual ally at the same time while portraying
                    relationships to appeal to them. Queerbaiting is very much
                    popular amongst artists who tend to create a false sexual
                    identity through their actions, work and statements, it is
                    even observed in several fiction modes of entertainment such
                    as films and television series. Many known singers have
                    pulled a PR stunt in order to gain the spectrum’s confidence
                    like the boy gone solo of the One Direction - Harry Styles
                    his song ‘Medicine’ was an explicit description of a
                    homosexual encounter, which was later labelled as “bisexual
                    anthem” by his fans and suddenly he was the queer icon of
                    the generation. But right after that his first single
                    ‘lights up in 2019 he was seen dancing with barely clothed
                    men and women, and it was found in correlation with imagery
                    in the lyrics “I’m not ever going back” and “Lights up and
                    they know who you are” which was released on National coming
                    out Day, doesn’t seem like a coincident since both the songs
                    suggested a hint of his sexual appeals as a bisexual, and
                    yet he denied about identifying as the same in the media,
                    which also gives strong evidence as a marketing scheme and
                    exploitation of the queer community which he does not want
                    to own up.

                    For someone who is still in the closet would appreciate the
                    support of an artist who is known all over the world, their
                    marketing schemes of queerbaiting makes it even harder for
                    these individuals to come out and also makes it harder for
                    them to trust someone the next time. This implication of
                    being a queer and then denying its presence leaves a message
                    that homosexuality is better left concealed which again
                    makes it very difficult for the community who as it is don’t
                    have adequate representation in media.

                    While we all celebrate pride month, with rainbows are
                    wishing our friends we forget how important it is to love
                    the spectrum for the rest of the year, because ‘LOVE IS
                    LOVE’ for all the twelve months not just the month of June.
                    While the pride month is to celebrate the spectrum we should
                    not forget that the awareness campaigns and education
                    initiatives should not be limited to a particular month, we
                    have seen how a number of start-ups, as well as existing
                    companies, have launched LGBTQ+ themed ads and products
                    without donating a single cent to the charities. This
                    representation should not be annual but must be included in
                    the daily sales and used in a normal protocol of its
                    business course, and as Indya Moore says “Celebrating Pride
                    month is giving to queer not selling to queer” thus,
                    exploiting the queer and using the rainbow as a marketing
                    strategy should be put to an end. As an ally, we should be
                    more empathetic and support them in their journey, as an
                    ally we should not tolerate bullying, hate speech and
                    threats made to our beloved members of the community,
                    they’re as much as human as we are.

                    Hi, I’m Dipali Banka- a 12th standard graduate, a proud
                    feminist, a heterosexual and an aspiring journalist. I have
                    social anxiety, and I’m not a people’s person but I always
                    have a ready hand to lend for those in need of help. My love
                    for books started when I picked up my first Harry Potter and
                    now I’m reading more of the political genre. I also love to
                    volunteer for social causes at NGOs and I adore Taylor Swift
                    because she makes me feel things. I joined Verity Today
                    because I’ve been following their works for quite some time
                    and I think it’s the best place to voice out for social
                    causes.
