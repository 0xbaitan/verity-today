                    Music, once viewed solely as an art, has now expanded to
                    such a large base of audiences and artists that it has
                    assumed the form of a business venture, transforming the
                    sector into a fully-fledged industry. Often, one may hear
                    about a record label backing the activities of a particular
                    artist, but the role that they play within the musician’s
                    discography is left unclear in the eyes of the public. For
                    the past century or so, it is the record labels that have
                    been influential in the growth of the music industry,
                    developing it into a commercial enterprise rather than an
                    artistic pursuit.

                      alt="image"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A record label is essentially a company that manages the
                    logistical parts of an artist’s music career, dealing with
                    aspects such as the production, marketing and distribution
                    of music, securing brand deals for their talent, and even
                    developing new artists who one day might be the next big pop
                    star. Their name is derived from the circular “label” in the
                    center of a vinyl record, on which is displayed the name of
                    the manufacturer and other copyright and trademark details.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Record labels mainly enter into business deals with
                    different artists with an agreement to look after the
                    promotion and advertising of their music, as well as other
                    logistical factors like the manufacture of CDs and album
                    units, or merchandise. While the artist focuses on making
                    the music that people around the world listen to, it is the
                    label’s responsibility to make sure that the music actually
                    reaches these people in the first place. Hence, while the
                    musician represents the artistic aspect of the transaction,
                    the record label is the backstage logistical head.
                    Financially, it is also the labels that provide budgets for
                    the production of songs and albums, as well as the filming
                    of music videos. They work just as the producers of a
                    particular film would, in securing funding and
                    administrative assistance to the stars in the spotlight.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In their activities, two distinct types of labels may be
                    distinguished. It is major labels that represent the world’s
                    biggest artists. These are supported by corporate backers,
                    and have a number of sub-labels, each of which is engaged in
                    a different aspect of the music industry, such as
                    publishing, distribution, or talent scouting. Some of the
                    prominent major labels are Universal Music Group
                    (representing Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande), and Capitol
                    Records (with Katy Perry and The Beatles). On the other
                    hand, independent labels are much smaller, and run on their
                    own funds without any corporate backers. It is usually these
                    independent labels that give support to the smaller,
                    up-and-coming artists (known as indie artists), and they are
                    regarded to be the equivalent of small businesses in the
                    music world. Artists who are not represented by any label at
                    all are said to be unsigned.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The scouting for these smaller artists is an essential
                    aspect of the labels, giving birth to the A&R (Artists and
                    Repertoire) division of the record label. These sectors are
                    responsible for finding artists who have potential to grow,
                    such that they may blossom into greater success under the
                    guidance of the label. Although A&R is vital for the
                    continued growth of the industry, recently, it has come
                    under great fire for the blatant exploitation of the signed
                    artists. Most famously, Taylor Swift has spoken out about
                    how, as a young artist, her record label contract with Big
                    Machine Records forced her to give up ownership of her songs
                    to the label. As a young artist, she was unable to negotiate
                    a better deal with the label, and this is the story of
                    millions of new artists around the world. Swift and other
                    global stars have been vocal about the need to protect the
                    rights and interests of these smaller artists, and to
                    prevent their exploitation in the contracting process.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    That isn’t to say only newer artists are harmed by such
                    contracts, though. The majority of profits derived from the
                    sale of music units is given over to the record label due to
                    the nature of the contract drawn up. This is because an
                    artist is expected to pay back the money that has been used
                    by the label in their support, with the revenue from the
                    sales. Consider a record deal where an artist gets an
                    advance of $500,000 at a royalty of 10%. Without delving
                    into the complex mathematics required, by the time the
                    artist breaks even (recovers the expenditure on the album
                    from the sales, when profit is 0), the label has already
                    profited $500,000.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Internal politics and preferences within a label can also
                    hamper larger artists. For example, let us consider the real
                    case of Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato’s new albums which
                    were released in the same week, just two months ago. Both
                    are signed under Scooter Braun’s record label; however,
                    greater funding and promotional campaigns were provided for
                    Bieber’s release due to his close ties with Braun, while
                    Demi’s album was practically hung out to dry. The natural
                    result was that Bieber performed better commercially, and
                    this initial (illegitimate) success was used as a further
                    incentive to fund Bieber rather than Demi.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A natural result of this foul play, catalysed by the rise of
                    the internet, has been unsigned artists attempting to make
                    their own mark in the world, without any label support. With
                    YouTube and TikTok, it is exponentially easier to produce
                    and distribute music for a larger audience, even from the
                    comforts of one’s bedroom, on one’s own terms. Shawn Mendes
                    is only one of the few who found popularity by sharing
                    covers on YouTube. The growing trend nowadays is to
                    initially put out music independently, and signing to a
                    label only after achieving some initial prominence. This
                    puts the artist in a successful position to leverage and
                    negotiate a deal with the higher-ups, with lesser chances
                    for exploitation.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While labels are losing their prominence in the A&R
                    division, they are still essential for the growth of an
                    artist after the initial success. Independent artists can
                    only go so far: it is with the funding and budgets of a
                    record label, along with large-scale frameworks for
                    production and distribution, that an artist can be propelled
                    to global fame. It is the balance between the creativity and
                    freedom of an artist and the business propensity of a label
                    that allows a contract between the two to flourish with
                    mutual benefits. Without record labels, the music industry
                    would cease to be just that: an industry.
