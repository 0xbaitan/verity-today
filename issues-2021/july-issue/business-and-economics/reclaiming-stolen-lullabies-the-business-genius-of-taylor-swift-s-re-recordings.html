                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In June 2019, the whole world woke up to the shocking news
                    that Taylor Swift no longer owned her own music. In a
                    surprise business move, her former record label, Big Machine
                    Records, had sold off her entire past discography to private
                    equity group Ithaca Holdings, founded by talent manager
                    Scooter Braun. Over the following two years, the controversy
                    has only gotten denser and more convoluted, requiring an
                    in-depth analysis of the business contracts that led to the
                    unethical sale, as well as the reaction by Swift that seems
                    to ensure that her legacy may end up in the right hands
                    after all.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    To begin, we must go all the way back to 2005: a 15-year-old
                    country singer from Nashville by the name of Taylor Swift
                    has just signed a record deal with a relatively new label,
                    Big Machine Records. Having found some success in performing
                    at cafes and small venues across the city, the young
                    musician is barely in a position to negotiate a proper deal
                    with her label, as is the case with most up-and-coming
                    artists. The resulting contract is, hence, somewhat
                    exploitative, but nothing new in the music industry: the
                    masters for Swift’s first six albums would belong not to
                    her, but to BMR instead. A master is essentially the
                    original audio recording of a particular song, from which
                    copies are made for sale and distribution, as well as usage
                    in other media, such as films or advertisements. Ownership
                    of a master affords an individual the right to that specific
                    recording of a song, implying that Swift’s albums available
                    for streaming and purchase would belong not to her, but to
                    BMR, owned by Scott Borchetts, whom she viewed as a father
                    figure.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Fast forwards 13 years later, to 2018. Swift is no longer a
                    small-town country singer, but a full-blown popstar with
                    global fame, having won ten Grammy awards and performed
                    sold-out stadium tours all across the planet. With the
                    expiry of her contract with BMR, she chooses to sign a new
                    deal with Republic Records, under Universal Music Group.
                    While her masters and recordings may not belong to her, the
                    actual songs (the lyrics and melody) themselves still did;
                    the original contract ensured that Swift would still
                    maintain writer’s rights over all her music, and since the
                    songwriter has been adamant in writing every single song in
                    her discography, 50% of all profits continued to go to her.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The new contract with UMG was a step-up not only for Swift
                    herself, but for all other artists signed under the label.
                    Now capable of leveraging her international status and fame,
                    Swift made certain that all her future albums would belong
                    to her absolutely. At the same time, the contract also
                    ensured that any sale of UMG’s shares in Spotify, the
                    largest streaming service, would result in profits (in the
                    form of equity) for all Universal artists.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Behind the scenes, Borchetta has been gearing up for the
                    sale of Big Machine to another company, which everyone
                    expected to be Universal Music Group. It was thus that the
                    acquisition of BMR by Ithaca Holdings came as a great shock
                    to most people in the industry, especially considering
                    Braun’s role in the company. As the manager to Kanye West
                    and Justin Bieber, Braun has been vocal about his distaste
                    for Swift, owing to the conflict between the artists that
                    has lasted nearly a decade. Although all these events were
                    perfectly legal from a business perspective, the ethical
                    standpoint became murky when Swift claimed that she herself
                    got to know about Braun’s purchase of her masters that
                    morning, along with the rest of the world. In a 300 million
                    USD deal, Braun had purchased BMR, 80% of whose profit and
                    revenue came from Swift’s discography. The controversy was
                    exacerbated when Bieber posted a picture with Braun later
                    that day, captioned “my friend just bought Taylor Swift”.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In a statement on Tumblr, Swift made clear that although she
                    was aware of BMR’s potential sale and had “made peace with
                    it”, never in her “worst nightmares” did she believe that
                    the buyer would be Braun, whom she accused of “incessant,
                    manipulative bullying”. The statement also revealed that she
                    had attempted to buy back her masters from BMR, but this
                    option was refused to her. Instead, Borchetta offered a new
                    10-year contract, as per which Swift would “earn back” each
                    of her past albums with every new one she released. However,
                    as she no longer wished to engage in business relations with
                    BMR, this contract was turned down. Swift’s masters being
                    taken from her is a brilliant case study on the complicated
                    relationship between business and morality: just because
                    something is legally viable for a corporation, does not mean
                    that it is the right thing to do. Her Tumblr post made it
                    clear that parting with her past work was a source of great
                    heartbreak:
                  </p>

                      “I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my
                      past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I
                      dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in
                      bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums. Now Scooter
                      has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an
                      opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is

                      happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for

                      concept.”</em

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Nevertheless, Taylor Swift is now a household name for a
                    reason- not only is she a talented musician, but also a
                    clever businesswoman. Although she may have lost the rights
                    to her masters, her retention of the writer’s rights meant
                    that she still owned the music and lyrics of all the songs
                    she wrote. It was only the original recording of the same
                    that belonged to Braun; hence, a new recording would belong
                    to her absolutely. In August 2020, she made it clear that
                    she planned on gaining control over her old music by
                    re-recording her past discography, creating a new set of
                    masters intended to completely replace the ones owned by
                    Braun. While fans were elated at the news, critics and
                    professionals were skeptical. Losing control of one’s
                    masters is a common tale in the music industry, with artists
                    like Kanye West speaking out about their unsavoury
                    contractual obligations, but few had gone to the painstaking
                    hassle of re-recording their music. Those that had done so,
                    had been unsuccessful in their endeavour, with the new music
                    being ignored. What these skeptics failed to account for,
                    however, is Swift’s huge fanbase and her hold over the
                    general public.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In February 2021, the re-recordings era officially began
                    with the announcement of ‘Fearless (Taylor’s Version)’, the
                    new rendition of her 2008 breakthrough hit album ‘Fearless’.
                    The rollout of the new music is a masterful business move
                    which few contemporary musicians would have been able to
                    execute properly. In order to devalue the masters owned by
                    Braun, the new versions were kept as similar to the original
                    as possible, in terms of lyrics, vocals, sound, and
                    production. However, as an incentive to encourage audiences
                    to purchase and consume the new album over the old one, she
                    unveiled vault tracks: never-before-released songs that she
                    had written for the albums, but had been left out for
                    various creative or logistical reasons. In doing so, Swift
                    ensured that her old masters would be deemed practically
                    worthless, with no profit going to Braun, as most of the
                    world would be streaming and purchasing the new albums to
                    enjoy the vault tracks as well.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Needless to say, the strategy paid off. ‘Fearless (Taylor’s
                    Version)’ topped the Billboard 200 charts, selling nearly
                    300k units in just one week. Meanwhile, the original album
                    fell off the chart entirely, and its sales and streaming
                    figures have been gradually declining. With one re-release
                    down, there are five still waiting to be released, but it is
                    evident that they too are gearing up to enjoy the same
                    success. In a matter of less than two years, Swift has
                    managed to pull off a business move that no other artist in
                    the music industry has been capable of. Perhaps, it is now
