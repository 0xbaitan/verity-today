                    An artist with astounding talent, sensibility and boldness,
                    Amrita Sher-Gil is remembered for having played a pivotal
                    role in subverting dominant ideas in twentieth-century
                    India. Her work, which explored the then taboo topics of
                    gender, identity and sexuality, paved the way for feminism
                    in modern India and has empowered women across the world for
                    generations.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Amrita Sher-Gil was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 30th
                    January, 1913 to a unique set of artistic parents. Her
                    father was a Sikh aristocrat, well-versed in Persian and
                    Sanskrit literature, who met her mother, a Hungarian opera
                    singer, just a year prior to Sher-Gil’s birth when she was
                    visiting Lahore.
                  </p>

                    <img

                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    From a very young age, Sher-Gil developed a reputation for
                    boldness. She was infamously expelled from a convent school
                    in Shimla for proclaiming that she was an atheist, which is
                    where her formal schooling came to an end. It is said that
                    she was only seven years old when she first began
                    illustrating the stories she read. In her words, Sher-Gil
                    wrote: “Rather independent at that age, it will be of
                    psychological interest to note that I detested the process
                    of ‘colouring in’ the drawings of picture books. I always
                    drew and painted everything myself and resented correction
                    or interference with my work.”
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    <img
                      src="/articles/July2021/Creativity/amrita-sher-gil-an-artist-beyond-time/IMG4.png"
                      alt="image"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In 1929, Sher-Gil went to one of the finest art schools of
                    the time in Paris to develop her skill as a painter. She
                    found interest in model painting and her most famous works
                    boldly depict the human form. She was heavily influenced by
                    modern aesthetics and a bohemian sub-culture while living in
                    Paris. She became a popular artist in Europe and her works
                    were showcased in big exhibitions in the early 1930s.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In 1935, Sher-Gil returned to India where, in some ways, she
                    rediscovered her art all over again. This was the beginning
                    of a certain reclamation of what it meant for her to be
                    Indian. Of her return to India, Sher-Gil writes that she
                    felt “haunted by an intense longing to return to India,
                    feeling in some strange inexplicable way that there lay my
                    destiny as a painter.” What affected art most significantly,
                    however, was her visit to the Ajanta and Ellora caves, where
                    the Ajanta Caves wall paintings and the sculptures of Ellora
                    “led to a series of visual and contextual reorientation in
                    her artistic quest.”
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Sher-Gil’s work includes a number of self-portraits in
                    various different styles of clothing, moods and expressions
                    — both Indian and European. A recurrent theme in her art is
                    that of the female body, which she explored in a series of
                    famous self-portraits at a time when it was not acceptable
                    for women to own their sexuality. By tweaking artistic
                    expression in terms of position, placement, colours and
                    shape, Sher-Gil used the female form in her paintings to
                    make significant statements about herself and the choices
                    she was making not only as an artist, but also as a woman.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The ‘Self Portrait as a Tahitian’, 1934 (pictured above), is
                    one of Sher-Gil’s most famous and captivating self-portraits
                    which shows her naked from the waist up. Influenced by the
                    paintings of post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin,
                    Sher-Gil uses expressive brown-shades of colour to
                    purposefully depict her not-white body as the ‘exotic
                    other’, thus making a powerful comment about feminism and
                    about the Western colonial lens through which Indians were
                    exoticised by their white rulers.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    She further liberated the image of the Indian woman by
                    depicting both the plain reality of her existence in popular
                    works such as ‘Three Girls’, 1935, ‘Red Verandah’, 1938 and
                    ‘Hill Women’, 1935, as well as her unique position in
                    society as a woman of sexual confidence and individual
                    identity in her portraits like ‘Nude’, 1931 and ‘Two Girls’,
                    1935. Women, for Sher-Gil, were not one-dimensional beings
                    that could fit into neat binaries of victim or winner. She
                    painted most of her work in bold strokes and earthly tones
                    which was a sombre portrayal of the reality of women who,
                    for her, are a lot like her own dynamic and complicated
                    identity.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Sher-Gil’s Indian identity was important to her. In an
                    article named ‘Modern Indian Art’ published in The Hindu
                    (November 1936), Sher-Gil wrote, “The Indian art committed
                    the mistake of feeding almost exclusively on the tradition
                    of mythology and romance. I am an individualist evolving a
                    new technique that though not necessarily Indian in the
                    traditional sense of the word, will yet be fundamentally
                    Indian in spirit.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Sher-Gil was a loud and active advocate for the end of
                    colonialism in India. The exploitation of Indians at the
                    hands of the British Empire and the harsh realities of the
                    everyday lives of rural Indians are captured in Sher-Gil’s
                    works, where her subjects always maintain the dignity of
                    their position as human beings. Her ‘South Indian Trilogy’
                    is regarded as one of her finest achievements. The three
                    portraits of the ‘Trilogy’ titled ‘Bride’s Toilet’,
                    ‘Brahmchari’ and ‘South Indian Villager Going to Market’ are
                    remarkable depictions of the lives of simple, ordinary
                    Indians living under the oppressive forces of colonialism
                    and patriarchy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Amrita Sher-Gil died on 5th December, 1941, at the age of
                    28. But in her terribly short life, Sher-Gil changed the
                    narrative of Indian women forever with her art, her passion
                    and her unapologetic fierceness. She can perhaps be
                    considered one of India’s first truly sexually liberated
                    feminists, who paved the way for a modernism in Indian art
                    and life that unapologetically broke conventions, both in
                    art and in life.
