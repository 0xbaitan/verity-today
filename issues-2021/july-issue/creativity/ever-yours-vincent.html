                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Vincent presents a type of escape within his sunflowers, and
                    almond blossoms, his field with irises and night cafés— one
                    that is sad, beautiful, and lonely. His art presents a sense
                    of comfort, belonging, and a type of relatability that
                    remains intact after an entire century—the experience of
                    loving Vincent's art is entirely personal. Vincent van
                    Gogh's art doesn't need the intense gaze of an art historian
                    to dissect his message, it is entirely universal.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Vincent of the paintings is often presented as the mad,
                    obsessed genius, his struggles and illness are often
                    romanticized by the media made in honor of him. To say that
                    Vincent was not any of those things would be wrong, but to
                    say that those were his only flares would be an
                    understatement.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Vincent was a brilliant artist but his literary prowess is
                    seldom discussed. There remains a collection of 903 letters
                    written by Vincent, sent to various receivers, most were
                    sent to Theo, Vincent's brother.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The letters give us a glimpse into who Vincent was, the man
                    behind the art. The letters are a portrait of a time long
                    left behind, the only holding memory of a place, the
                    testament of a profession. The letters are a journal,
                    portraying the turbulence of his life and the building of
                    his aesthetic.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The evidence of Vincent being tremendously passionate is in
                    his art, the evidence of Vincent being unable to take an
                    ounce of criticism is in his letters. Vincent was a couple
                    of things, being understanding was not one of them. For
                    instance, Vincent's relationship with his family had always
                    been faulty, it is through the letters that we see that the
                    corresponding family drama had reached its height when Van
                    Gogh was in his late twenties. What stands out though, is
                    the fact that throughout it all, the letters also present to
                    us the example of a family trying their best to stay
                    together despite their divide. Van Gogh's aforementioned
                    inability to take criticism stems from his familial issues
                    and is the primary reason why he would never last under any
                    artist for too long. It is fair to say, that as loveable as
                    his rebelliousness is on paper, the reality of his situation
                    was quite exhausting to live with.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The letters further legitimize the fact that Van Gogh was
                    severely inconsistent. His thoughts, ideas, and opinions
                    changed and developed rather rapidly. For the sake of
                    comedic purpose, Van Gogh once wrote to Theo about his love
                    for the author, Jules Michelet. Jules Michelet was famous
                    for having written a book on the French revolution, Vincent
                    though was professing his love for the books Michelet wrote
                    on how to pursue women and love, at times even comparing
                    these books to the Bible. The Bible. He says the Bible is
                    'eternal' but Michelet's books give him clear instructions
                    on how to navigate modern times.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A year later, Vincent wrote to Theo, 'I am going to destroy
                    all my books by Michelet and I wish you would do the same.'
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Vincent van Gogh's passion for art is the one thing
                    highlighted the most within his letters to Theo. Vincent's
                    progress in art, and his journey to finding the style he is
                    synonymous with today, is well documented within his
                    letters. Van Gogh had trouble being under anyone's
                    instruction for too long, part of this could be attributed
                    to the fact that Van Gogh was a late starter. Van Gogh still
                    needed to learn drawing. His solution was to follow Charles
                    Bargue's Drawing Course religiously. The letters have
                    captured every frustration and anger he had felt whilst
                    still learning to develop his skills. After the initial
                    outburst, came Van Gogh's most introspective feelings about
                    his failures. He compares his process of learning to the
                    birth of a child—pain and then, joy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Van Gogh had the innate ability to see the inherent beauty
                    of things so mundane and normal. He once told his brother
                    that life was seen through a lens of art by him. He was
                    capable of feeling great appreciation and joy for the most
                    mundane of things. In his letters, he's written plenty about
                    how the beauty of nature overwhelms him. His metaphors are
                    primarily natural processes, the hurried sketches he
                    scribbled on the letters, the ones that reflect his art the
                    most are mostly things that belong entirely to nature. He
                    draws of growth and decay and seasons, of fields filled with
                    irises and vineyards splashed with red at noon, of starry
                    nights and olive trees, of hospitals and houses and café's
                    he's seen—he draws of things he wants to remember. He draws
                    of things never standing and entirely fleeting. His letters
                    contain endless scribbles of paintings, which would later
                    become iconic. Entire letters were simply dedicated to
                    orders of colors and canvases, Van Gogh was ever eager to
                    describe anything to do with art.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Van Gogh's life work was a product of a mere decade's work.
                    His paintings were spontaneous and impulsive, and he wrote
                    plenty about how he could paint as 'quick as lightning'. At
                    the near end of his life, he was painting two or three
                    canvases a day. Van Gogh's letters also show that he
                    understood quite a lot about his illness. In a time wherein
                    much was not known about mental illnesses, Van Gogh
                    recognized that he needed help. That his illness revealed
                    itself in episodes, that he needed to be in isolation when
                    these episodes occurred and that his well being could be
                    assured if he kept himself engrossed within work.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Van Gogh's last letter to Theo talks of the ability of
                    painters to solely communicate through the art they produce.
                    Van Gogh praises Theo for being one of the only art dealers
                    he knows who works with humanity, who understands the
                    essence of art. He signs the letter off the same way he had
                    for all the proceeding ones, only this time, it would prove
                    to be his last. He bid his brother goodbye with a simple,
                    known — Ever Yours, Vincent.
