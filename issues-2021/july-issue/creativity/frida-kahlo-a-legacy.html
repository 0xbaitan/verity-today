                    Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is remembered for her
                    self-portraits, pain and passion, and bold, vibrant colors.
                    She is celebrated in Mexico for her attention to Mexican and
                    indigenous culture and by feminists for her depiction of the
                    female experience and form.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Kahlo, who suffered from polio as a child, nearly died in a
                    bus accident as a teenager. She suffered multiple fractures
                    of her spine, collarbone and ribs, a shattered pelvis,
                    broken foot and a dislocated shoulder. She began to focus
                    heavily on painting while recovering in a body cast. In her
                    lifetime, she had 30 operations.

                    Life experience is a common theme in Kahlo's approximately
                    200 paintings, sketches and drawings. Her physical and
                    emotional pain are depicted starkly on canvases, as is her
                    turbulent relationship with her husband, fellow artist Diego
                    Rivera, who she married twice. Of her 143 paintings, 55 are
                    self-portraits.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Kahlo's first self-portrait was Self-Portrait in a Velvet
                    Dress in 1926. It was painted in the style of 19th Century
                    Mexican portrait painters who themselves were greatly
                    influenced by the European Renaissance masters. She also
                    sometimes drew from the Mexican painters in her use of a
                    background of tied-back drapes. Self-Portrait - Time Flies
                    (1929), Portrait of a Woman in White (1930) and
                    Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky (1937) all bear this
                    background.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In her second-self portrait, "Time Flies," Kahlo uses a folk
                    style and vibrant colors. She wears peasant clothing, and
                    the red, white and green in the painting are the colors of
                    the Mexican flag. During her life, self portrait is a
                    subject that Frida Kahlo always returns to, as artists have
                    always returned to their beloved themes - Vincent Van Gogh,
                    his Sunflowers, Rembrandt, his Self Portrait, and Claude
                    Monet, his Water Lilies.

                    The 1937 painting Memory, the Heart, shows Kahlo's pain over
                    her husband's affair with her younger sister Christina. A
                    large broken heart at her feet shows the intensity of
                    Kahlo's anguish. Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera divorced in
                    1939, but reunited a year later and remarried.

                    divorce. One Frida wears a costume from the Tehuana region
                    of Mexico, representing the Frida that Diego loved. The
                    other Frida wears a European dress as the woman who Diego
                    betrayed and rejected. Later, she is back in Tehuana dress
                    in Self-Portrait as a Tehuana (1943) and Self Portrait

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There's no doubt that Kahlo expressed herself through her
                    art but her avant-garde style also represented her bold
                    personality. From extravagant floral headdresses and
                    accessories to sharp, constructed suits, her style was
                    boundless. She would beautifully ecorporate both traditional
                    Mexican and European elements of clothing. Tehuana dresses,
                    huipil tops (each having its own intricate design), long
                    embroidered skirts and robezo scarves were a recurring part
                    of her wardrobe. Her Mexican culture played an important
                    role in her style, the tehuana dresses being worn by the
                    indeginous women of Oaxaca state, Mexico and the huipil
                    tops, common in Mayan groups.The robezo scarves were used by
                    female revolutionaries during the Mexican revolution to
                    smuggle guns in order to end the decades long dictatorship
                    of Porfirio Diaz and became symbolic of the revolution.

                    to cover her disabilities has been beautifully adapted into

                    Riccardo Tisci showcased Frida’s struggles in his Givenchy
                    Fall 2010 Couture line. He highlighted the bones of the
                    spinal cord and the rib cage by using beaded embroidery, the
                    zippers were designed like little bones and even the belt
                    was shaped like the spinal cord.

                    Naeem Khan’s Spring/Summer 2014 Ready-to-wear collection had
                    a Latin/Spanish backdrop. His inspiration for this
                    collection included everything from flamenco dancers to
                    Frida Kahlo. The models wore braided hair and the creative
                    vibrant patterns were tokens of Frida's influence.

                    In Rouland Mouret’s Spring/Summer 2018 show, he celebrated
                    Frida Kahlo for her raw expression of women’s lives and
                    Georgia O’Keeffe as she rejected the idea of fear even
                    though she herself was not fearless and her paintings
                    contained an element of femininity and seductiveness.

                    Frida Kahlo’s impact was international and strong traces of
                    her work and style can be seen clearly today. A true
                    visionary in her own right, she paved the way for artists of
                    the generations that came after her. Art is boundless, and
                    so is the inspiration of their creators, and it is something
                    that should always be celebrated and respected.
