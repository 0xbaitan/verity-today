                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past six
                    months, you probably already know who Olivia Rodrigo is. The
                    Disney actress starring in ‘High School Musical: The
                    Musical: The Series’ exploded into fame in January 2021 with
                    the release of her debut single ‘driver’s license’, which
                    peaked the Billboard Hot 100 chart and went viral across the
                    entire planet. Her two follow up singles also landed in the
                    top 10 of the chart, and her music industry takeover has
                    only been exacerbated by the release of her first studio
                    album, titled ‘SOUR’.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In past interviews, Rodrigo had spoken about how the release
                    was initially meant to be a much shorter EP, which she
                    extended to a full-length album following the success of
                    ‘driver’s license’. Initially, I found this concerning, as
                    it seemed like she would be adding songs to the project at
                    the last-minute which didn’t deserve to be on the tracklist.
                    However, with the very first listen to the album, it’s clear
                    that there isn’t a single song that feels like a filler
                    track. With ‘SOUR’, Rodrigo has crafted the perfect ode to
                    teenagedom in all its angst, heartbreak, mood swings and
                    messiness. The very first track, ‘brutal’, is well placed at
                    the start of the album, as it sets the bitter and furious
                    tone for the rest for the release. “I want it to be, like,
                    messy”, she quips, before accelerating into rock-inspired
                    heavily distorted guitar riffs, loud drums, and screaming
                    vocals. “I’m so sick of seventeen / where the hell’s my
                    teenage dream?”, she sings in light of the disillusionment
                    of being an adolescent in the modern world. The alternative
                    rock and punk sounds drive home the general theme of
                    dissatisfaction and rage experienced by most teens.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The primary plot throughout the album, however, explores
                    Rodrigo’s relationship to an unnamed boy, who soon left her
                    to date another girl. Although the paparazzi and internet at
                    large have made several assumptions about who these
                    individuals are, it is not necessary to discuss the
                    relationship drama while examining the quality of the songs
                    themselves. ‘Traitor’, the second song on the album, begins
                    the relationship narrative. Lush with ghostly vocals and
                    simple instrumentals, the singer-songwriter details the
                    betrayal she felt when she was left behind by her ex, even
                    though he had not explicitly engaged in an illicit affair;
                    “guess you didn’t cheat / but you’re still a traitor.”
                    Undoubtedly, the climax of the song appears in the bridge,
                    where the full emotional scope of Rodrigo’s pain comes
                    through as she spits out every word in bitter rage and hurt.
                    The emotion is clearly audible in her voice- a talent which
                    even seasoned artists find hard to channel into their
                    recordings- and transforms ‘traitor’ from just another
                    breakup song to a standout track.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The track ‘good 4 u’ is another song with a similar style to
                    ‘brutal’, laced with sarcasm and passive aggression as she
                    clinically deconstructs her ex’s indifference to their
                    breakup: “you look happy and healthy, not me // I’ve lost my
                    mind, I’ve spent the night crying on the floor of my
                    bathroom”. As the third single in the album release cycle,
                    it was a perfect choice, as it cemented Rodrigo’s status as
                    not a mere one-hit wonder, but a developing artist capable
                    of putting out hit after hit of varying sounds, styles, and
                    diversities. ‘Happier’ brims with all the pettiness that can
                    be expected in the aftermath of a relationship, as she sings
                    about her past lover’s new girlfriend. While she wishes for
                    him to find joy in the future, she selfishly hopes that it
                    would never match up her own experiences with him: “So find
                    someone great but don't find no one better/ I hope you're
                    happy, but don't be happier”. Once again, she displays a
                    tenacity for switching from one musical genre to another, as
                    ‘happier’ is almost waltz-like, with a swinging beat and a
                    piano sequence that sounds like it’s straight out of a
                    1950’s ballroom.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As would be expected, Rodrigo has come under fire for
                    writing “too much” about her breakup- a sexist criticism
                    which seems to be a rite of passage for all women in the
                    music industry. ‘Jealousy, jealousy’, however, is the
                    epitome of the inaccuracy of this baseless accusation,
                    perfectly summarising adolescence in the age of social
                    media. The song explores the envy and inadequacy felt when
                    comparing oneself to the “girls too good to be true/ With
                    paper-white teeth and perfect bodies”. Personally, it’s my
                    favourite track on the album, and also the one that is the
                    most relatable. Sleek with a sultry bass guitar riff and
                    vocals that are nearly shouting in the bridge, the track
                    presents an anthem of rebellion against the facetuned and
                    photoshopped illusions of curated fantasies that pollute and
                    infest Instagram and Snapchat alike.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Perhaps the only miss on the album (for me) is the final
                    song, ‘hope ur ok’. Closing tracks hold an important place
                    in an artist’s discography: it’s the final statement that
                    they put out within the current body of work, until a few
                    years later when the next release comes out. As such, I
                    prefer these tracks to be personal and intimate. In the case
                    of ‘SOUR’, however, ‘hope ur ok’ is the only track that
                    doesn’t deal with Rodrigo herself, instead delving into
                    homophobia and domestic violence. A heartwarming track of
                    solidarity and allyship, it would have been perfect anywhere
                    else in the tracklist, but falls short as the final track of
                    an album which has so closely followed the inside of the
                    mind of a teenage girl for ten tracks, only to jump out and
                    extrospect.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Overall, ‘SOUR’ is a brilliant debut album, especially for a
                    seventeen-year-old. In just a week of its release, it has
                    broken several records, topping the Billboard 200 albums
                    chart, and logging the highest streaming week on Global
                    Spotify. The chaotic ricochets from loud, rock-inspired
                    electric guitars to tear-jerking piano ballads serve as a
                    perfect metaphor for the instability and intricacy of
                    teenage life, a phase that is often dismissed by adults by
                    being immature and trivial. Olivia centres the trivial in a
                    blend of melodrama and emotion, crafting a superb package of
                    fluorescent adolescence.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Who am I if not exploited?” she screams out in the opening
                    track. Sure, there’s moments of joy and satisfaction in
                    juvenile life, but modernity has failed the youth; the
                    overwhelming experience is one that is bittersweet, and
                    rather <strong>sour</strong>.
