                    The International Convention on the Suppression and
                    Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid defines apartheid as a
                    series of inhuman acts that are “committed for the purpose
                    of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial
                    group of persons over any other racial group of persons and
                    systematically oppressing them.” Moreover, the State of
                    Israel ticks nearly every box in that definition.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Israel was established on 14th May, 1948, to create a
                    national homeland for the Jews fleeing persecution in
                    Europe. This, however, forced the native Arab population of
                    Palestine to escape their country, leaving behind their
                    homes, their land and all their property. By 1949, almost
                    80% of the Arab population of Israel had fled the country
                    and over 720,000 Palestinians had become stateless refugees.
                    Nonetheless, a considerable part of the Arab population
                    stayed on, interrupting the fundamental structure of the new
                    Jewish state and, effectively becoming Israel’s chief
                    crisis. As a result, the leaders of the state were forced to
                    present a racist settler-colonial apartheid regime as a
                    liberal democratic nation that could protect the rights of
                    all people and be, as they claimed, “both Jewish and
                    democratic.”
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Today, Palestinians have no right to return to the homeland
                    they were forcibly removed from (although any Jew from any
                    part of the world has the right to obtain citizenship in
                    Israel), no right to reclaim the property they had to leave
                    behind while fleeing their country, no right to
                    self-determination, and they are also legally prohibited, as
                    an ethnic minority in Israel, from observing any cultural
                    traditions to commemorate the loss of their homeland. Israel
                    does not merely work towards making the colonised
                    Palestinians socially inferior and irrelevant, its racism is
                    written into the policies of the nation. The discrimination
                    is sanctioned by the the State’s most fundamental legal
                    documents. To establish that Israel indeed is an apartheid
                    state, a comparison can be drawn with South Africa, where
                    the term originates.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning separateness. Across
                    the three centuries over which European colonialism laid
                    down the structure of apartheid in South Africa, racial
                    discrimination and exclusion took from the indigenous people
                    their land, their rights, and their freedom. They were
                    forced to work as labourers under inhumane conditions, they
                    were beaten or killed if they so much as spoke up and they
                    were treated no better than slaves by settler-colonial
                    foreigners in their homeland.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In 1948, apartheid was introduced as a policy to systemize
                    this racism by the National Party. Under this policy, the
                    indigenous people were politically suppressed, systemically
                    incarcerated and territorially segregated, forced to live in
                    ‘bantustans’ which were residential areas set aside for the
                    natives. This area included only thirteen percent of the
                    total land area of South Africa even though it was meant to
                    be occupied by the indigenous people who formed the majority
                    of the population and for whom this land was their home.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In South Africa, reserved land belonged exclusively to the
                    natives. In Israel, while Palestinian citizens can only
                    inhabit parts of the land and the rest belongs entirely to
                    the Jews, there is no law that forbids the settlers from
                    also occupying the land that has been set aside for
                    Palestinians. Therefore, Israel’s land division and
                    distribution, by people who have no real claim over it, is
                    even more discriminatory and burdens the Palestinians more
                    than South African laws did the natives of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Israel’s citizenship laws can very easily be compared to
                    South African inter-racial marriage laws and to policies
                    that racially segregated the people, While Israel does not
                    prohibit inter-ethnic marriages, its laws make family life
                    very difficult by assigning different areas of residency to
                    the Jews and non-Jews of the nation. These laws are enacted
                    in an attempt to discourage interbreeding of the colonisers
                    and the indigenous people. In Israel, like South Africa,
                    social and cultural practices are certainly factors enabling
                    apartheid. But it is the institutionalisation of this racial
                    discrimination and segregation by a state-sponsored and
                    state-sanctioned method of oppression that makes Israel an
                    apartheid state in 2021, decades after the world
                    collectively demanded the end of apartheid rule in South
                    Africa. Desmond Tutu, a South African anti-apartheid and
                    human rights activist, drew a comparison between the two
                    countries that tells us how similar both the apartheid
                    regimes are:
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “I have witnessed the racially segregated roads and housing
                    in the Holy Land that reminded me so much of the conditions
                    we experienced in South Africa under apartheid… The systemic
                    humiliation of Palestinian men, women, and children...is
                    familiar to all black South Africans who were corralled,
                    harassed, insulted, and assaulted by the security forces of
                    the apartheid government.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In the history of colonialism, whenever settler-colonial
                    states were unable to wipe out the native population, the
                    colonial regime worked to make them politically irrelevant.
                    Israel, as a settler-colonial and apartheid regime, has
                    worked no differently since its very establishment as a
                    nation and continues to treat its Palestinian citizens as
                    second-class citizens on their native land. Israel’s laws
                    continue to create a divide between its Jewish and
                    non-Jewish citizens, often erasing Palestinians as a people
                    altogether even though they form a significant section of
                    the country’s population. It is essential to oppose and
                    stand up against an oppressive racist regime and its war
                    crimes and to speak out against the discrimination and
                    suppression of an entire people, which has been perpetuated
                    for nearly a century.
