                    If you know anything about me, it's that I adore music, so
                    much so that you can constantly find me wearing a pair of
                    headphones, humming along to some song. Usually, though, I’m
                    too restless to sit still while listening to music, so I try
                    to find some simple games on the app store that I can
                    mindlessly tap and play through to only give my fingers an
                    avenue to fidget. One such game I downloaded a few months
                    ago was the ‘Cats Are Liquid’ series, which seemed like a
                    simple platformer game on the surface. But the moment I
                    began playing it, it became clear that there was a much
                    darker and significant storyline lurking beneath.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Unfortunately, I have been unable to find much discourse on
                    this game online. For this reason, I had to piece together
                    the plot points of the game. The series comprised two games:
                    ‘A Light In The Shadows’, and ‘A Better Place’. Although
                    ALITS was the first game to be released, it is agreed
                    amongst the fanbase that ABP is a prequel to the original
                    game, despite being released afterwards.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Both games feature simple gameplay whereby the protagonist,
                    a cat called Lumi, needs to manoeuvre her way through
                    various obstacles. In ABP, Lumi is joined by three other cat
                    friends. Multiple dialogue boxes scattered across the levels
                    subtly reveal that the cats had an owner who had died. Thus,
                    leaving them behind in total shock. In the wake of grief,
                    the four friends created the world of the ABP. It was done
                    to help each other through their grief and eventually move
                    on out into the real world.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As the levels progress, each of the friends can recover and
                    leave the makeshift until Lumi is the only one left behind.
                    Unfortunately, she is unable to get over the loss of her
                    owner. At the end of the game, she decides to lock herself
                    into a new world of her creation.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    ALITS begins in this new world, although Lumi seems to have
                    no recollection of the events in the previous game. She
                    claims that she has been locked in the world by the owner.
                    The game features 90 levels spread across nine worlds. Each
                    of them ends with its own distinct “neon level”, where we
                    can see the cat conversing with another unnamed and
                    unspecified group, assumed to be her friends from the first
                    game. Through the course of the neon levels, her friends
                    plead with Lumi to return to the real world:
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “You just have to try to move on. We know that it’ll be
                    difficult, but you have to try. It’s the only way out. We
                    know that dealing with a close friend's death can be
                    difficult… We were there with you. You have to try to move
                    on. Staying in a world where death has no consequences
                    doesn’t help.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    With the neon levels, Lumi’s intentions become clear: the
                    game breaks the fourth wall here. Acknowledging that “death
                    has no consequences” as you can respawn at the start of the
                    level and try again. Lumi, too, is aware of this and has
                    chosen to trap herself in a deathless world in an attempt to
                    distance herself from the grief at her owner’s death. As she
                    progresses through ALITS, she repeatedly comments on how the
                    rooms seem to be forming endless loops, having forgotten
                    that it was her own doing. Although she claims she wants to
                    make it out of the “claustrophobic world”, the final level
                    sees her suddenly change her mind, no doubt an effect of the
                    vow she took at the end of ABP to stay locked inside the
                    world, and never leave: “Everything is so much better in
                    here. Everything can be fixed. Nobody will die. All that
                    happens is that the room will be reset. Everything can
                    always be fixed. I want to start over. Do this all again.
                    Over and over again. So that I never have to leave.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It is at this point that the main game ends. With this, a
                    new world is unlocked, called “The Reset”. Here, the levels
                    are backwards numbered, starting from 10 and counting down
                    to 1, implying that Lumi is making her way back to the start
                    of the world to restart the game in a loop. Within The
                    Reset, Lumi finally talks to her dead owner, who, like her
                    friends, encourages Lumi to let go of her hurt and move on:
                    “You can’t blame me for my own death. It was clearly an
                    accident. Nothing could’ve been done to prevent it.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When I first saw this game on the Play Store, it seemed
                    utterly whimsical and ridiculous, although it soon turned
                    out to be nothing of the sort, and I am glad it did not. It
                    is rare for any mainstream media, especially video games, to
                    tackle such heavy topics. Such overarching representation
                    can only go far in the public approach to mental health. The
                    entire game stands as a metaphor for the process of working
                    through grief and the importance of having a proper support
                    system in place to help you through it, as represented by
                    Lumi’s friends.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    However, the key message of the game is that the final
                    decision to move on can't be influenced by anyone else. It
                    must be taken by oneself. Moreover, this decision comes at a
                    different pace for everyone: some, like the friends, can
                    accept the circumstances quicker, while others like Lumi
                    find it harder to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    No one can be blamed for the death and the emotions that
                    follow. The game serves to be a cautionary tale to its
                    players. It is important to take your time to heal
                    completely and accept help when it is offered, no matter how
                    difficult and improper it may seem. While it may seem ideal
                    to wallow in sorrow for the rest of one’s life, the best
                    step that can be taken, for both the deceased and the
                    bereaved, is to move on into a better place.
                  </p>
