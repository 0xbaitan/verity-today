                    For a long time, society had drawn a clear line between what
                    professions were careers and what were mere hobbies. On the
                    one hand, those with intensive foundations rooted in
                    studies, employment stability and lucrative salaries were
                    considered careers. On the other hand, those that require a
                    studio apartment to live in till thirty without workplace
                    savings plans (401Ks) were considered stepping stones. More
                    intuitively, a ‘year off’ before they start a ‘proper
                    career’.

                    After years of advocating, researchers have found
                    substantial evidence that music and art are just as
                    important to this world as finance and computers. However,
                    despite the changes that have come about, inherent and
                    orthodox beliefs about different aspects of life still
                    surface, albeit in a more hidden and implicit way. These
                    days, rather than antagonising the unconventional career
                    itself, people urge students to push themselves into the
                    more mainstream ones out of fear. It is the fear of failure,
                    instability, and the inability to live life on their own.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Our journey through self-discovery starts at school. A large
                    part of our personalities is shaped in these years,
                    regardless of whether we enjoyed our experiences. Those who
                    enjoyed the company of their peers know a little about the
                    general kind of people they are comfortable around than
                    those who weren't aware whether they felt comfort or
                    discomfort around other people.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Our life goals come within the purview of our interests in a
                    particular subject during these years. However, school and
                    education curricula, due to the need for uniformity, are
                    rigid. Examinations and syllabi are set, in a way, to
                    primarily influence decisions as to what students may like
                    to pursue in their higher education. However, due to the
                    unscalable depth of information and peer influence from
                    others who stick with mainstream professions, our education
                    has often edged along a specific curve.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There is a school of thought that considers certain subjects
                    to be of common interest. Hence, institutions deem them as
                    necessary while labelling others as extra-curricular. Even
                    in the subjects themselves, there are well-defined but
                    restrictive domains of study material that only caters to
                    few topics. For example, our history textbooks teach us
                    about how the reign of Louis XIV was prominent as France
                    reached heights in terms of economic prosperity and
                    flourished in art forms such as music and art. However,
                    there is a bare minimum mention of the Baroque period which
                    took place around the same time. The mention of the rise of
                    legends like Bach and Vivaldi who introduced the concepts of
                    sonata and concerto which are still very prevalent today
                    remain absent in our textbooks.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The inadvertent prioritisation of subjects fuels the idea
                    that some careers or academic subjects require more
                    nurturing and effort than others. It inevitably raises
                    self-doubt and anxiety among those who wish to pursue
                    careers with little to no representation at career
                    counselling. It is common to feel like such careers are
                    insignificant and fruitless when there is no growth or
                    popularity. Combined with the constant rise in unemployment
                    and poverty, fear is only natural among an already
                    distressed youth. This ‘do or die’ complex has driven away
                    so many from their dreams of pursuing something that they
                    loved with their heart and soul.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A survey conducted on over 10,000 students (between the ages
                    of 14 and 21) in India showed that over 70% of those
                    students were only aware of seven career options. The
                    options included medicine, computer and IT technology, law,
                    finance, engineering, design and management. India has over
                    250 career options, which are inclusive of 5000 job types.
                    It shows that children are not just scared to pursue their
                    calling. It also highlights their breadth of knowledge about
                    different options is only limited to safe and conventional
                    ones.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    What rests in the unknown is a commonplace of fear among
                    teenagers and adults alike. We, as a species, like to have
                    things figured out. It is the reason why conversations
                    regarding ‘your plan after school’ are exasperating. Most
                    teenagers take a long time, ridden with anxiety over the
                    wrong choice and fear of regret, to figure out what they
                    want to do in life even with all the information laid out in
                    front of them. When crucial information is held back,
                    especially regarding a potential career choice that may be
                    appealing but assures a lot less certainty when it comes to
                    success, it drives anxiety amongst people who do not see
                    themselves fitting into any of the options laid before them.
                    When this happens, people start settling for what they may
                    have been taught to be the safest option. Eventually, the
                    crippling fear of failure subsides into a dull ache that
                    lingers between confusion and regret.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There is a growing acceptance of humanity’s need for
                    millions of different professions. Professions that were
                    once hobbies can be pursued and still be considered
                    significant. It does not eliminate the need for doctors or
                    engineers. It simply integrates the importance of every
                    career such that there is a deserved equity of respect and
                    importance of every profession.
