                    Friends. Our chosen family. They are there for fun and
                    laughter, as well as being there through difficult times. We
                    share things with friends which we are not comfortable
                    sharing with our family. It is no surprise to us that
                    friends are, in fact, a vital part of our lives. Be it just
                    an acquaintance or our closest friend, they all affect us,
                    but in different ways and magnitudes.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As human beings, it is natural to have conflicts with people
                    you love. Of course, all of us occasionally get into a
                    quarrel or two with the best of our friends. However, the
                    real question is, when does it start to get toxic? When and
                    how are you supposed to identify that this “friendship” is
                    doing no good to any of you?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There is a simple answer to that. When you start feeling
                    that you are being held back by your friend, that is the
                    moment when you must realise that something needs to be done
                    urgently. It is very emotionally draining to have someone
                    weigh you down. In most cases, you probably will not even
                    realise that it is the person that you believe to be your
                    close friend who is weighing you down. It is precisely where
                    the complications arise. We are so blindsided by the fact
                    that our friend could never possibly do any harm to us, that
                    we lose ourselves in the process. Toxic friendships are more
                    common than we think. We just fail to identify it.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In a utopian setting, any relationship, be it romantic or
                    platonic, must always have an equal balance. It means that
                    there should be initiation and effort from both individuals.
                    They should be enough to keep the relationship going without
                    mentally draining one person out. Unfortunately, the world
                    is not perfect, neither are we. Therefore, we cannot always
                    expect that kind of balance at all times. What can we expect
                    then? Well, ask yourself, what do you expect from your
                    friends? Your company is supposed to make you feel good.
                    They are supposed to tell you if they sense you are going
                    wrong somewhere and respect your decisions. They are
                    supposed to make you feel motivated, not drained out and
                    frustrated. It works both ways; you give, you receive. That
                    is how simple it is. Friendship is no rocket science after
                    all!
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Now coming to toxic friends, we’ve heard this term several
                    times in our life. So, who is a toxic friend, and how
                    harmful can they be?
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A “friend” who does not make you feel loved or supported.
                    One who makes you feel insecure and even questions your
                    identity. They disregard all your problems and expect you to
                    understand theirs. They will use you in their times of need
                    and forget about you when you need them the most. It is the
                    suffocating toxicity that some “friends” have to offer that
                    these are only a few of the things that such people
                    generally do. They proceed to call you their “bestie” to
                    your face while they snicker behind your back or not even
                    try to hide the fact that they are toxic.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    What can a toxic company possibly do to our mental health?
                    For starters, it feels like all the energy has been leeched
                    from us; however, we cannot tell how. Even if we can, we do
                    not have the courage or energy to stand up against our
                    wrongdoers. Talking to that individual feels like a mammoth
                    task. At the same time, we feel guilty for not interacting
                    enough with them. We lose our self-esteem, confidence and
                    blame ourselves for what is happening. Its impact is more
                    significant than what we may believe.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    One may suffer from anxiety or depression, owing to a toxic
                    friend solely. In severe cases of gaslighting and mental
                    abuse, one may even reach a point of suffering from
                    post-traumatic stress disorder. As for cases involving body
                    shaming, victims get pushed into eating disorders. It not
                    only aggravates their mental health but also their physical
                    health.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Now that we're aware of the severity of having a toxic
                    company, how do we identify and act on it?
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    First, we should gather our thoughts and reflect upon what
                    WE feel, not the other person. For once, prioritise
                    ourselves over others. Identify the issue and then come to
                    the main question.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Ask yourself, is all this mental abuse worth this
                    friendship? One way of figuring it out is clear
                    communication and working things out like mature individuals
                    rather than internalising and making things worse. Even
                    after repeated second chances, if you still do not feel
                    secure or supported, then there is, sadly, only one way out.
                    Distance yourself, for your good. It is not necessary to end
                    on bad terms and completely cut each other off. The distance
                    with the space you require to breathe is what you need. The
                    change will be gradual and liberating. Coming from a person
                    who recently got out of a stiflingly toxic and problematic
                    friendship, I can positively claim that it is one of the
                    best feelings one can feel.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Yes, you will inevitably miss the good moments, but
                    sometimes, it is just better to let go of your well-being.

                    On this note, I present to you a typical Pinterest quote:
                    “Don’t let getting lonely make you reconnect with toxic
                    people. You shouldn’t drink poison just because you’re
                    thirsty”.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As much of an angsty teenager quote, it sounds, it is true.
                    As I said earlier, friends are like your chosen family, your
                    escape from many of your problems, so choose the ones who
                    will stay throughout as your hype-people, not as
                    energy-draining leeches.
