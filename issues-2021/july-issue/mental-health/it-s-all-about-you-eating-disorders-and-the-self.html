                    An underlying feeling that overwhelmingly shapes our
                    self-image and influences our behaviour could be called our
                    insecurity. Do you ever find yourself filled with
                    self-doubt, lack of confidence and uncertainty?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Insecurity is a feeling which you have that is often
                    accompanied by a critical inner voice and manifests in the
                    form of our anxiety or uncertainty as self-deprecating
                    words. We fear that others will judge us.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Hence, before they do, we start looking for flaws in
                    ourselves. At times we may doubt our appearance, style,
                    personality, the way we talk, and sometimes we question our
                    very existence.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Some of us worry that we are not where we would like to be
                    in our personal or professional lives. Others feel that they
                    are too incompetent to pursue a demanding career or worry
                    that their appearance lacks a certain quality they might
                    find in others.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    People are critical of themselves for not meeting a certain
                    standard or level of achievement set by others. Nowadays,
                    most individuals on social media only display what they want
                    others to see — a pretence that masquerades the reality
                    beneath it. With vague ideas or guesses, we compare
                    ourselves to them and question if we are good enough to
                    reach where they are in life.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We are either being compared to someone or put in a position
                    to compare ourselves to one another. Judgment perpetually
                    follows this and often causes us to dwell in our
                    insecurities.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Insecurities cause mental health issues, depression, low
                    self-esteem, and anxiety. Being insecure is not simply
                    self-assessment. While there is always room for improvement,
                    self-criticism and self-doubt in all matters is not the
                    right way.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    At some point in life, almost everyone has insecurities.
                    Although, there is a fine line between being insecure and
                    self-assessment. What being insecure means is that your
                    insecurities control your life, and they take over your
                    personality.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    All you see are your insecurities. Without even making an
                    effort to change yourself, you decide you are not good
                    enough. Meanwhile, having self-doubts is just a part of you
                    and neither is it your identity.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When you tend to improve yourself and work on it, you remind
                    yourself of your strengths, skills, and talents. Being
                    insecure turns into a self-sabotaging mechanism.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Self-assessment allows us to grow because we notice our
                    flaws and tend to work on them.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    On the other hand, by being insecure, we are consumed by our
                    flaws which do not allow us to reach our full potential as
                    our inner critical voice says it is not good enough.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    An eating disorder is not simply just not eating. People
                    often comment how “it's no big deal just to eat”, but it is
                    hard for them to comprehend how damaging this phrase can be.
                    They say that “it is a choice, not an actual illness”. It is
                    when a person starts developing unhealthy habits like
                    obsession with food, body weight or shape. We have to watch
                    out for controlling calories or comparing our bodies to
                    standards set by society.

                    It is crucial to identify symptoms of an eating disorder or
                    even the start of it. If failed to stop, the person might
                    live an extremely unhealthy life that could affect their
                    social and professional lives. Unfortunately, it is also
                    associated with an extremely high mortality rate.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In these times, we see millions of people on social media
                    with millions of likes on their pictures or having a large
                    following. Inadvertently, we notice the body type they
                    possess and believe that this is how it should be, but
                    accepting this only makes you unhappy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Society makes us believe that a thinner body is the ideal
                    body, but that is not it. The biggest lie that we have been
                    told on multiple occasions is that a thinner you is
                    superior. But in reality, it is just simply a different
                    version of you, not a happier one. People might judge you on
                    your weight or how you look, but in all honesty, it does not
                    matter.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As long as you believe in yourself, are satisfied with what
                    you eat, like how you look, other people’s opinions should
                    not matter. The person commenting about you is just simply
                    saying it, but that does not mean that it is how you look,
                    because in the end, what matters is what rests inside you;
                    how you see yourself.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Do not let someone else's judgment take away your happy
                    years. It is not worth it. At first glance, we might notice
                    someone’s body and immediately realise what is inside them.
                    It is their personality that catches our attention. Because
                    in the end, people do not remember your weight but what you
                    were like as a person. The weight scale or how people see
                    you do not affect your beauty, strength, purpose or
                    possibilities.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Our society has set a very high standard on how one's body
                    should look. This high standard is hard to achieve and may
                    sometimes be unachievable too. The media and social media
                    constantly swamp us with images of ‘idealised bodies’. For
                    women, the emphasis is on slimness, youthfulness and
                    flawless skin. For men, the ideal body is characterised by a
                    muscular, V-shaped body and a flat stomach. And these utopic
                    standards of beauty have become the norm to which many of us
                    compare ourselves.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Many studies have shown that in this modern age of social
                    media, the vast majority of people on these platforms are
                    unhappy or dissatisfied with their body image. Recently, the
                    focus has moved from a general and temporary dissatisfaction
                    to a more serious aspect of how one’s body image can
                    influence our mental health.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Although body image concerns are indirectly linked to mental
                    health concerns, they can cause mental health problems and
                    issues over time and unhealthy behaviours that include
                    eating disorders. Issues that can emerge as a result of poor
                    body image include depression, anxiety, lower self-esteem,
                    social isolation.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    However, we have to remember that society came up with the
                    idea of the ‘ideal body type', referring to what is
                    appealing to their eyes. Maintaining a healthy body is
                    necessary. However, prioritising your mental health is also
                    of utmost importance. Fortunately, many psychologists,
                    medics and other professionals worldwide work to support
                    people with poor body image. But until the causes are
                    eliminated or at least reduced, the problem remains and is
                    becoming increasingly urgent.

                    “I had a moment the other day that really changed my
                    perspective on how I view my physical appearance. I released
                    that no one has ever impacted my being beautiful or having
                    the perfect body. It might get my initial attention or be
                    inspiring but it's never the reason I remember them. I'm
                    impacted by the people for their kindness, their loyalty,
                    their patience, generosity, or vulnerability. I’ve never
                    said that she changed my life because she is pretty or
                    skinny. We spend so much time worrying about the thing that
                    means the least to a lot of people.” - Becca Tilley from the
                    bachelor.
