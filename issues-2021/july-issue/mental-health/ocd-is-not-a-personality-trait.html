                    yourself that you have OCD without really giving a second
                    thought to it. Well, news flash! OCD is nothing less than a
                    legitimate anxiety disorder or mental illness.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder where
                    people experience recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or
                    sensations that compel them to do something repetitively.
                    Repetitive behaviours, for instance, excessive hand washing,
                    checking on things or cleaning, can cause significant
                    disturbance in day-to-day activities and social
                    interactions.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In recent times, people have been carelessly associating one
                    or a few traits with OCD. As a result, the term has been
                    extensively misappropriated by many and used casually in
                    conversations. Consequently, the delegitimization of the
                    word has been detrimental to patients with OCD. The problem
                    lies in the fact that people belittle OCD patients of their
                    experiences and reduce their illness to a mere personality
                    trait.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    If OCD brings only the simple desire for everything to be
                    organised, clean, repeated, and rearranged, then it would
                    not be an illness. The misuse of the term indirectly or
                    directly causes people to believe that the disorder is not
                    as debilitating as it truly is.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As a result of this, people conceive the notion that OCD has
                    no crucial implications. They believe it is more akin to an
                    everyday worry. OCD may appear harmless at first glance but
                    has lethal effects on people suffering from this disorder.
                    From having grotesque, disturbing and sexual thoughts
                    leading to ludicrous actions, it is nothing short of agony.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    OCD is not just about effectuating perfection or being
                    germaphobic. According to NOCD, a telehealth provider that
                    caters to people with OCD:
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Some people with OCD are preoccupied with excessive
                    thoughts about germs or contamination, some with rigid
                    morality, some with a need for symmetry, balance, or
                    numerical patterns. One common form of OCD involves
                    intrusive thoughts of terrible things happening.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Let us take an example. Assume that someone preoccupied with
                    excessive thoughts of cleanliness might keep washing their
                    hands, legs and other body parts until these thoughts fade
                    away. Sometimes this activity can even lead to bleeding.
                    Yes, it is that severe an issue.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    OCD sufferers generally have impertinent or neurotic
                    thoughts related to an incident in their lives. While there
                    are no official classifications of OCD, research suggests
                    people experience OCD symptoms in four main categories:
                    cleaning and contamination, symmetry and order, forbidden,
                    harmful, or taboo thoughts and hoarding.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    According to PSYCH GUIDES:
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Sufferers who have a fear of contamination may take baths
                    and wash their hands many times throughout the course of one
                    day, or they may be obsessed with cleaning every inch of
                    their home to ensure it is spotless and free of germs. OCD
                    sufferers who hoard items are obsessed with making sure they
                    keep everything they have ever owned, even if the item is
                    worn out or useless. A person who hoards becomes emotionally
                    attached to items, and the very thought of throwing things
                    away can cause great distress.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    OCD sufferers generally feel anxious over things that might
                    seem trivial to non-sufferers but affects them severely.
                    Apart from the evident mental trauma, there are no physical
                    signs of OCD. Only in rare cases, when sufferers become
                    intractably obsessed with the fear of contamination, it
                    usually leads to bleeding, rashes, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There are short-term as well as long term implications. A
                    sufferer might face a problem while nurturing an intimate
                    relationship, friendship or even maintaining their desired
                    schedule. Long term implications include depression,
                    increased rate of irritability and anxiety (leading to panic
                    attacks). Adults with OCD have a greater than 75% chance of
                    having another anxiety disorder or panic attack in their
                    lifetime.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In this age of social media, people can foolishly do
                    anything to sound fancy. Especially claim to have an ailment
                    that appears sophisticated to them. Obsessive-compulsive
                    disorder makes it to their list.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Keeping one's workplace immaculate and tidy does not give
                    one the audacity or right to claim to have OCD. Another
                    crucial thing to look at, whenever an individual claims to
                    have OCD, it is usually followed by a superior giggle as if
                    they are proud to have an ailment with a voguish name. That
                    is preposterous and messed up on so many levels.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The internet is doing more harm than good. Websites all over
                    the internet upload videos, publish articles and blogs on
                    OCD and make it seem less detrimental than it is. It only
                    makes it seem more enigmatical for the actual sufferers of
                    OCD.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The misuse of the term OCD has made it more arduous for
                    genuine sufferers to seek professional health. The internet
                    and society have made a mockery out of this serious ailment.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Having OCD is just way more than being a neat freak or
                    pernickety. Actual sufferers will only feel lackadaisical
                    and anguish if we fail to spread awareness of this illness
                    and make a mockery of their suffering.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    How can we help the sufferers of OCD?
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;1. Encourage the sufferers to express their emotions
                    openly. However, do not compel them to share their ordeal.
                    Be patient and affable towards them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;2. Ask and encourage them to seek professional help
                    like therapists. Assure them that OCD is not something to be
                    embarrassing or unsettling.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;3. Educate yourself on OCD from professionals rather
                    than the internet. Try to clear out various myths and
                    misconceptions of OCD that you may have considered.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;4. Make them feel comfortable and provide them with
                    emotional support. Remember that sufferers often tend to
                    feel anxious or even depressed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;5. Some parts of OCD treatment can be afflicting and
                    demanding. Ask them what you can do to make them feel a
                    little less antagonised and flustered.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;6. Instead of silencing the sufferers, support their
                    journey. If they are faltering at a job, try to be
                    accommodating and understanding towards them.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &emsp;7. Do not exert pressure on them. Instead of
                    delineating people with OCD as pushovers, we should
                    earnestly task them with appropriate jobs.
