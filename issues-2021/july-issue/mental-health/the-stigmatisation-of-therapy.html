                    Therapy. Merriam-Webster’s dictionary describes it as the

                    disorder. More commonly known as a practice that many

                    Individuals tend to believe that those who attend therapy
                    are wasting money, weak, incapable of dealing with their
                    emotions, and called insane, to name a few. It is an
                    incredibly harmful stereotype that still sees the light of
                    day in 2021.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    To many, therapy is an intimidating concept. People treat it
                    as a last resort for patients who need to seek professional
                    help. It is because a diagnosis is usually required to avail
                    it.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    About 48% of the population seek professional counselling.
                    However, it is often quite a difficult decision to make. It
                    is due to the negative stigmas and stereotypes surrounding
                    the concept of therapy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In reality, most people who seek professional help are
                    simply in need of a safe space to speak to and receive
                    advice from someone experienced and unbiased.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Such negative connotations of therapy can be traced back to
                    its portrayal in the media. Whether it is the individual
                    seeking therapy in the sitcom, or the punchline of the show,
                    or showing exaggerated and crude demonstrations about how
                    certain mental illnesses look like, for example,
                    schizophrenia. The media almost always shows therapy in a
                    negative light.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Schizophrenia seems to be the epitome of ridicule in modern
                    society. When individuals think of schizophrenia, they do
                    not think of the negative thoughts that patients must be
                    hearing in their head constantly. Instead, these individuals
                    continuously demean their self-image and gnaw at their
                    self-esteem.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    They do not acknowledge the strain such mental illnesses can
                    inflict on relationships that the patient may have with
                    their family and friends.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In TV or movies, one would notice people with schizophrenia
                    are often the ones with tangled hair and large dilated eyes,
                    proposing theories and concepts of human life that many
                    would not consider normal. Producers depict their rooms as
                    messy; peculiar objects and furniture placed in odd
                    positions in their rooms are a common trope. They often
                    become the punching bag of the show.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I cannot help but think that their ideology has devolved
                    into the: “Are we out of original content? No worries, let
                    us make fun of the mentally ill individual for simply
                    existing LOL.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Yes, I can make the argument that all stereotypes derive
                    from some vague truth. I agree that society has pushed many
                    mentally ill individuals beyond the point of ‘normality’
                    where they cannot act per the norms of modern society. When
                    they disobey these stringent norms, they are most likely to
                    be ridiculed by the people they considered to be their
                    closest allies.

                    intense or extreme versions of their mental illness are all
                    ‘insane’ or ‘crazy’ is incredibly harmful. Going as far as
                    generalising those with mental illness (milder versions
                    included) to be weak or incapable to any degree is
                    disdainful. It leads to the further devolvement of society.

                    They doubt that their mental illness is deserving of help
                    from a therapist. They often buy into the idea that others

                    worry or question themselves if they are faking it since
                    they would have already known about it. Even if an
                    individual is indeed faking a mental illness, it would be a
                    different and separate mental health issue altogether.

                    Therapy, in its true essence, is just counselling another
                    individual from their medical impairment. The role of a
                    therapist is to ensure their patients are at their best
                    state to function as contributing members of society. The
                    simple action of ridiculing an individual brings them to a
                    state where they keep their suffering to themselves.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A solution to this particular situation would be to reduce
                    the stigma which is emanating from the public. Corrigan and
                    Penn (1999) stated their three ways and approaches to
                    reducing overall public stigma. Those cited were protest,
                    education, and contact. They suggested that these steps help
                    in reducing the exaggeration and misinformation made by
                    television shows and movies (media in general).
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Protests. By protesting against said misinformation and
                    signalling how the reality of mental illness is more than
                    just a punchline, we can initiate destigmatisation.
                    Psychotherapists and other professionals should be
                    encouraged to speak out against all misleading information
                    that reaches the masses. Moreover, they bear the moral
                    responsibility to do so since they possess the most
                    expertise in their respective fields.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Education. We should prioritise educating the public on why
                    the insensitive and inaccurate portrayal of characters with
                    mental illnesses is damaging. Putting factful and palatable
                    information on the mode of entertainment can help enhance
                    one’s knowledge of the mental illness at hand.

                    Fair representation of characters with an actor who has
                    maybe gone through such an event in their life can make a
                    difference. Besides, simply just helping people understand
                    that maybe laughing at the crazy one in that show may be
                    humorous to someone but incredibly triggering for someone
                    else. Failure to do so may cause individuals to feel
                    invalidated and drive them away from help.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Contact. It would be the act of having personal contact with
                    individuals that have sought help from therapists before. It
                    could also mean having contact with those who have been
                    through the mental illness and may show symptoms. Having
                    this contact would blur the lines between people who seek
                    help and people who do not feel the need. Therefore,
                    creating a more fluid, inclusive, and educated society.

                    To reduce self-stigma: one of many studies (Rosen, 2003) has
                    shown that many people would feel less stigmatised and
                    ridiculed if society normalises their actions, behaviour and
                    symptoms. They would be prone to feel less ashamed and less
                    guilty for seeking help. Discussing how normal it is to
                    struggle with varieties of mental illnesses and how common
                    diagnosis is may also decrease the stigmatisation and help
                    people get rid of the ideology that seeking help is a bad
                    thing.

                    In all honesty, seeking help is one of the toughest and
                    intimidating decisions to make. Living through it and
                    seeking help for something you are internally struggling
                    with is incredibly brave. Hence, we should all admire those
                    who took the courage to better themselves.

                    The more we normalise therapy, the less of an issue it
                    becomes. Many therapists can assist individuals through the
                    burden and stigma that they feel. We could consider this as
                    a step taken in the right direction towards normalising
                    therapy.

                    Everyone deserves recovery. Everyone deserves support. You
                    are not better off because you have a milder version of
                    someone else’s struggle. You are just as important. You are
                    not any less of a person for having someone help you get
                    through life. Life is by no means simple. It is
                    understandable if some people have someone helping them make
                    the journey a little smoother.
