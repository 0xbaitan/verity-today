                    In recent times, the world has become aware of sexism and
                    misogyny in the most unexpected place — pop culture. There
                    is a special contempt reserved for young people who choose
                    to analyze the media they love or publicise their love for
                    it on the internet, and when this media solely makes spaces
                    for young female individuals, it’s hard to avoid the
                    conclusion that this contempt is gendered. Why are One
                    Direction fans met with a brand of judgement or disgust that
                    cricket fans are never met with? And do age-old gender
                    stereotypes play a role in categorising and hierarchizing
                    media as ‘masculine and ‘feminine?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Let us take the most common comparison — pop music vs
                    sports. There is a preconceived notion that pop music
                    fandoms are mainly female or queer-dominated ones and sports
                    fans exhibit a certain brand of masculinity that is
                    associated with the cisgender heterosexual male. This
                    gendering of forms of entertainment is inaccurate, but let
                    us put that aside for a moment. Modern-day pop music fans
                    are dismissed for having silly interests and, for most fans,
                    this results in a lot of shame and a need to justify their
                    involvement with pop fandoms. Sports, on the other hand, has
                    always been considered to be a legitimate and sensible
                    interest, if not inspiring and educational for those who
                    closely follow it. The frenzied loyalty of sports fans to
                    specific teams is never mocked or dismissed. Such interests
                    are considered normal and appropriate by society because
                    these fans adhere to the prescribed standards of
                    ‘masculinity’. If we compare a Taylor Swift concert to a
                    Manchester United vs. Arsenal football match, we don’t see a
                    real difference in the volume of yelling and cheering, the
                    number of painted faces or the kind of enthusiasm expressed.
                    It's the pitch of the shrieks that makes all the difference
                    in how society perceives these two groups of very excited,
                    very loyal fans.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Not only does this result in the dismissal of one group’s
                    interests and the pedestalizing of another, but it also
                    reveals how we perceive media through a gendered lens and
                    create hierarchies in forms of entertainment based on the
                    gender identities of its supporters. The media that tries to
                    create a space for female individuals to feel included and
                    seen doesn’t necessarily market to women, but it is
                    automatically labelled ‘feminine’ media and, by extension of
                    society’s definition of femininity, it is automatically
                    considered ‘frivolous’. For instance, Little Mix songs are
                    never considered to be meaningful or sophisticated and
                    mainstream media has, for far too long, portrayed Taylor
                    Swift as a vengeful woman writing shallow songs about
                    break-ups. So whenever artists create spaces for women or
                    make them feel heard, their art becomes ‘shallow’ and their
                    fans ‘foolish’.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When it comes to female-dominated fandoms and the backlash
                    they face, the term ‘fangirl’ and the negative connotation
                    attached to it becomes an important point to address. Why
                    has a word which should mean a fan who identifies as female
                    turned into such a dirty term? It has become a pejorative
                    term used to dismiss and belittle an entire section of all
                    fandoms — a primarily young, female section. Not only is it
                    hard for women to own spaces that have been created for them
                    without facing backlash for it, it also becomes harder for
                    them to admit to themselves that they are, in fact, fangirls
                    (the actual definition really does refer to a female fan)
                    because of the negativity that is associated with it.
                    Similarly, the term ‘fanboy’ should technically refer to a
                    male fan. But today, the term is used as a derogatory one
                    for those men who have typically ‘feminine’ interests. A
                    17-year-old football fanatic or a 45-year-old diehard
                    cricket lover will never be called a ‘fanboy’. But male fans
                    of Ariana Grande will. As the term was invented much after
                    the term ‘fangirl’, it is commonly used to refer to a man
                    who has fangirl-like interests and is, therefore, not
                    ‘manly’ enough. Thus, the term ‘fanboy’, in the way in which
                    it is used today, becomes inherently sexist because it not
                    only humiliates men who have so-called ‘feminine’ interests,
                    but it also used to insult the male version of a fangirl,
                    furthering the idea that being a fangirl is something silly
                    and shameful.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Another layer of gendering reveals itself when a woman
                    claims to be a dedicated fan of supposedly ‘masculine’
                    interests. For instance, female football lovers are often
                    dismissed by male fans — or quizzed by men to test whether
                    their knowledge and devotion to the sport is at par with
                    that of men. Such sports are traditionally considered too
                    ‘manly’ for women and, therefore, beyond their
                    understanding. And pre-existing gender stereotypes play an
                    important part in why this occurs.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The patriarchal idea of an ‘ideal’ woman is that of a quiet,
                    composed woman who is supposed to have no opinion, no voice
                    of her own and is simply an extension of a man. Men,
                    typically, were associated with brute strength and
                    aggressiveness. This, even in 2021, plays a part in how
                    women are received in typically ‘masculine’ circles. Much of
                    society finds it hard to associate women with a sport that
                    is characteristically very aggressive. The thought that a
                    woman cannot really be interested in a particular sport
                    because it’s too ‘manly’ and, therefore, beyond her
                    comprehension, is essentially discriminatory. But besides
                    that, this thought also comes from a very archaic idea of
                    how men and women should be but be that, in the twenty-first
                    century, should be behind all of us. It’s high time that
                    people of any and all genders are allowed to decide for
                    themselves what they are interested in instead of society
                    defining where their interests should lie. It’s high time we
                    stop belittling pop culture fans as having frivolous and
                    non-serious interests or for publicly expressing those
                    interests. And it’s high time that we stop letting
                    regressive and primitive gender stereotypes hold us back
                    from loving what we truly love.

                    dramas and Grey's Anatomy. I joined Verity because of the
