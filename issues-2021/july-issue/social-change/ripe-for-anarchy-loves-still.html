                    Feminism has had its roots actively intertwined with queer
                    liberation since the 1960s, influencing each other as two
                    movements in portraying solidarity in struggle. They have
                    both fought for the basic right to equality between people
                    regardless of their gender or sexuality, trying to curb
                    society’s inherent prejudice against them and fighting
                    discrimination based on the same. Shared struggle and trauma
                    has formed a bond of understanding between the two movements
                    and they have had an impact on each other to achieve, what
                    is, at its core, the same goal. The two movements have, far
                    too often, been studied as separate ‘objects’. However,
                    looking through the past and the present, it is evident that
                    no two movements that have the values and impact of this
                    magnanimity can ever be completely separate. They all focus
                    on people. And anything to do with people, especially those
                    who have been oppressed and discriminated against for
                    centuries, can never be as simple as one problem to be
                    addressed.

                    Feminism is chronologically older than the LGBTQ+ movement,
                    with its first wave of advocacy for gender equality hitting
                    in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. First-wave
                    feminism advocated equal property rights for women,
                    discarding the idea of the subordinate position of married
                    women to their husbands. By the late 19th century, feminist
                    activism was primarily focused on women’s suffrage. The
                    second wave of feminism brought out the concerns of
                    lesbians’ fight for specific rights against sexism. The
                    National Organisation for Women, a feminist organization
                    that aimed to end sex-classified employment notices, for
                    greater representation of women in government, for
                    child-care centres for working mothers, and for legalized
                    abortion. This period converged with the beginning of the
                    long silent LGBTQ+ movement in the 1950-60s when in 1955,
                    Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon formed the Daughters of Bilitis
                    (DOB), the first national organization for lesbians. It
                    aimed to end the feelings of isolation and seclusion felt in
                    the community, to educate them about their legal rights to
                    integrate social acceptance and fight for the social and
                    political equality of lesbians. Therefore, when the second
                    wave of the feminist movement struck, lesbians played an
                    important role in advocating civil rights equality in the
                    workplace, home and public without discrimination based on
                    gender or sexuality.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This was when the term ‘Lavender Menace’ was attached to the
                    lesbian community. Many in the movement were against the
                    involvement of lesbians in the fight for their own rights,
                    insinuating that they would corrupt the integrity of the
                    movement by driving away women out of fear of association
                    and drawing too much attention to themselves. Lesbians were
                    also facing the marginalization of their ideologies by their
                    male counterparts in the mixed-sex gay rights organizations.
                    Although this led to the establishment of a movement to
                    support pride in the lesbian community, the alienation of
                    women in the feminist movement is an almost cruel irony. It
                    disregarded an entire community of women, telling them to
                    not fight for their rights. Sexism victimizes every woman,
                    regardless of their sexuality. The inequality in salary is
                    something that every woman faces in the workplace, whether
                    or not they belong to the LGBTQ+ community. It is equivalent
                    to telling them that they have to make a choice between the
                    two; that being a woman in the LGBTQ+ community is not an
                    option, that they are pariahs. To tell any woman that they
                    should not fight for their basic right to equality in
                    society, for the simple idea that they are their own
                    independent people who do not need to measure their value in
                    accordance to their affiliation with a man not only
                    belittles the character but portrays feminism as selective,
                    which is aimed to be anything but.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Feminism refers to the non-variable equality among people
                    and prohibition of discrimination on grounds of gender. It
                    isn’t technically possible to integrate equal social and
                    political rights for people in the LGBTQ+ community and
                    counter societal shame with pride without the prerequisite
                    of gender equality. Women in the community are a huge
                    section of the people that are affected by sexism. Without
                    feminism liberating every single person from the constraints
                    of gender inequality, the liberation of every person in the
                    LGBTQ+ community cannot be achieved. The success and impact
                    of feminism is a major stepping stone for the queer
                    community to be truly liberated.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The queer liberation movement has been to inculcate societal
                    acceptance of people belonging to the community and to rid
                    the world of discrimination based on one’s sexual
                    orientation. The main objective of the feminist movement has
                    been to tear down the belief that our roles in the world and
                    the opportunities we get should be influenced by gender; to
                    fight society’s inherent gender-based discrimination. The
                    goals of both these movements are to fight the constructed
                    ideas of society and the places of those who belong to it.
                    The similar values they employ- of respect for every
                    identity and objectivity in general decisions, such that
                    their identities do not become the basis for their place in
                    the world, professional and otherwise show the
                    interconnectedness of their struggles. While the two
                    movements fight against different strains of
                    marginalisation, they have converged, to fight a fight that
                    is not necessarily polar.
