                    In a recent conversation with some friends online, one of
                    them said that sports aren’t art, and it’s truly boring to
                    sit through an entire sports match. I immediately took
                    offence and thought to myself, “this person didn’t see the
                    greatest premier league team of all time”. Liverpool got
                    thrashed 7-2 by Aston Villa, a team that was celebrating not
                    getting relegated from the Premier League. This person
                    didn’t see Barcelona get humiliated and thrashed ‘8-2’, and
                    this person never felt the joy of seeing their team win a
                    trophy.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Well, a lot of fans did, and these are the teams that made
                    them proud.

                    The Premier League saw
                    <strong>Manchester City</strong> being crowned as champions
                    yet again. However, they lost the Champions League final and
                    didn’t make it to the FA Cup Finals either. The citizens
                    lifted their 5th Premier League title, the 4th in 5 years.
                    If any manager were to be given 1.2 billion USD to spend,
                    they shall win 5 titles in 5 years. City kicked off the
                    season with a poor 5-2 defeat at the hands of Leicester City
                    in late September 2020, conceding poor goals and not scoring
                    several with Sergio Aguero sidelined and Gabriel Jesus being
                    unable to step up to the mark. But, the signing of the
                    brilliant Ruben Dias for £60million from Benfica in the
                    Portuguese League and another defender Nathan Ake for
                    £40million was a game-changer. Pep Guardiola’s side made a
                    rallying 27 game long winning streak and won the league
                    comfortably by match week 25, officially scoring 86 points.

                    <strong>Manchester United</strong> finished 2nd, scoring 74
                    points, which was 5 more than third-place Liverpool. The
                    Red’s had a shaky start to the season and were 15th for the
                    first 2 months of the 2020-2021 season. Poor losses to
                    Crystal Palace and an embarrassing 6-1 thrashing to
                    Tottenham of all teams found Ole Gunnar Solksajer in between
                    a rock and a hard place.

                    But, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford stepped up to
                    steady the ship witnessing United find a new identity as
                    “second-half fc”, going unbeaten away from home for the
                    entire season and garnering the most points from losing
                    positions. United was atop the table come January. However,
                    poor recruitment and shoddy performances saw them hand City
                    the top spot.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    United’s star man and their Portuguese Magnifico, Bruno
                    Fernandes also broke the record for most goals scored by a
                    midfielder in all competitions, finding the net 28 times
                    beating Chelsea ‘legend’ Frank Lampard for the record by one
                    goal. 40million pound marquee summer signing Donny van de
                    Beek, however, did not appear to play a massive part
                    throughout the season, appearing mostly in garbage time
                    around the end of games. The same cannot be said about
                    free-agent arrival Edinson Cavani. The 34-year old found the
                    net ten times in twenty appearances and provided some great
                    moments.

                    end to the season, with 69 points in a “remarkable”
                    achievement by their manager, Jurgen Klopp. The team was
                    smashed 7-2 by previous season relegation-threatened Aston
                    Villa at the start of the season. They also saw main-man
                    Virgil van Dijk gets injured and ruled out for the entire
                    season after a nasty tackle by Everton goalkeeper Jordan
                    Pickford in the Merseyside derby. Joe Gomez, Joel Matip,
                    Diogo Jota and Jordan Henderson were also important
                    Liverpool players who went out this season with injuries.
                    Jurgen Klopp was forced to rely on the Liverpool academy but
                    was greatly disappointed after seeing the defensive
                    ineptitude of Rhys Williams, and hence played Fabinho and
                    Henderson in defence for the majority of the season.

                    a job after being sacked by the club in late January of
                    2021. Former Mainz, Borussia and PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel
                    took over and did a phenomenal defensive job and unlocked
                    the potential of Kai Havertz and Mason Mount. He also saw

                    finishing 16th, turn up the heat and bring some fresh air
                    and competition into the top 10 and even top 4 of the
                    Premier League. A fantastic comeback from the club and
                    manager David Moyes, with standout performances from Tomas
                    Soucek, Vladimir Coufal, Aaron Creswell, Declan Rice and
                    late-season addition Jesse Lingard.

                    <strong>Tottenham Hotspurs</strong> finished 7th in an
                    underwhelming season which saw a strong start but piss-poor
                    performances and just embarrassing defeats throughout the
                    end of the season. Spurs found Harry Kane and Heung-min Son
                    carry them to the Europa League Conference places, with the
                    former winning both the Golden Boot after netting 21 times
                    and also the Golden Ball after assisting 14 times this
                    season. The team also saw manager Jose Mourinho getting
                    sacked amid the European Super League conundrum and
                    28-year-old ex-Tottenham player, Ryan Mason taken to the
                    dugout.

                    threatened with relegation in patches of the season.
                    Ex-Arsenal “legend” Mikel Arteta showed his true colours to
                    be just a greasy-haired, suave looking fraud of a manager

                    Tottenham a run for their money. Bielsa’s men played
                    non-stop attacking football, which saw Leeds garner a
                    reputation as a no-nonsense, attack-minded machine of a
                    team. Patrick Bamford stepped up to the mark, as did new man
                    Raphinha in a season in which Leeds fell victim to
                    embarrassing defeats such as a 6-1 loss to Manchester United
                    but also perpetrators of 5-0 hammerings to the likes of West

                    Rodriguez from Real Madrid. Dominic Calvert-Lewin stepped
                    into the role of the target man and manager Carlo Ancelotti
                    started building something special at Everton.

                    underwhelming latter half of the season, which was capped
                    off by Ancelotti getting snatched up by Real Madrid again.
