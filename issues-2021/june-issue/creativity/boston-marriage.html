                    ‘The Bostonians’ by Henry James included a kind of
                    relationship between its two main female protagonists—Olive
                    Chancellor and Verena Tarrant—that was, at the time,
                    relatively unknown. ‘The Bostonians’ used the term Boston
                    Marriage to better establish and explain the two ladies’
                    relationship, seemingly inventing the term. However, James’
                    sister, Alice was also involved in a Boston Marriage with
                    Katherine Loring, a history professor, thus proving that the
                    phenomenon existed long before James explored it.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    By definition, the term refers to the monogamous
                    cohabitation of two, upper or middle-class women independent
                    of financial support from a man and was an occurrence
                    usually in the late 19th and early 20th-century in parts of
                    the UK and US. Whether or not these partnerships were
                    romantic and/or sexual, remains a topic of heavy debate.
                    However, back in the late nineteenth century, wherein women
                    were encouraged to not interact with men, the phenomenon of
                    a Boston Marriage was oftentimes common, and surprisingly,
                    socially acceptable. The earliest recorded occurrence of
                    such a marriage was amongst two Anglo-Irish upper-class
                    women--Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby. The two were
                    settled in a town in Wales, where they were lovingly called
                    the title of ‘Ladies of Llangollen’.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It is necessary to understand that although these marriages
                    can be accepted as examples of early female-presenting
                    same-sex relationships, it cannot be dismissed that there
                    exists an alternative, more practical reason that can be
                    attributed to the popularity of this phenomenon in certain
                    social groups. It has to be reiterated and highlighted that
                    most women that were in Boston marriages came from
                    financially stable families and were, therefore, able to
                    sustain a career for themselves because they were educated
                    or make a living out of their inherited wealth. Women,
                    especially those part of the suffragette movement at the
                    time, were highly critical of the institution of marriage as
                    it fundamentally restricted their freedom. In retaliation,
                    they created a phenomenon that supported them both in public
                    and private lives.
                  </p>

                      class="img-fluid"

                  </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The phenomenon was also immensely prevalent in women’s
                    colleges and boarding schools, wherein having a crush on
                    another woman was considered part of school life. Nancy
                    Sahli in 1979 wrote, that such relationships within colleges
                    were accepted by almost everyone as it was viewed as women
                    simply having a more emotional nature than men. Testament to
                    the fact, the term ‘Wellesley Marriage’ became a term
                    because ‘Boston Marriages’ were immensely popular amongst
                    professors of the Wellesley College. Towards the start of
                    the twentieth century, there was a rise of middle-class
                    women who also started participating in Boston Marriages.
                    Because Boston marriages were not officially legal, most of
                    these women remained seemingly single whilst being in
                    committed, lifelong relationships. This was fairly reflected
                    when in the period between 1890 and 1920, the percentage of
                    never-married women was the highest than any other era, in
                    the US.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    After the 1920s, there was a rapid decline in the social
                    acceptance of any kind of relationship that challenged the
                    heterosexual model of ‘family’, it became common to label
                    any such relationship ‘abnormal’. It has to be understood
                    that before this, there existed hardly any study on women’s
                    sexualities and desires, leading people to believe that
                    women simply did not have those qualities. Boston marriages,
                    in particular, were viewed as strictly asexual
                    relationships. However, Havelock Ellis’s influential book
                    ‘Sexual Inversion’, identified these relationships as being
                    ‘unhealthy’ and possibly sexual, thereby effectively
                    starting the cause of the phenomenon’s decline. In the 1920s
                    and 1930s, there no longer existed the previous acceptance
                    of such relationships, and girls who partook in such
                    relationships in school were often sent back home to be
                    ‘healed back to heterosexuality’. For the rest of the
                    century, there existed almost no such accepted phenomenon
                    that opposed the societal norms of heterosexual
                    relationships.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    That is until the Stonewall riots took place in 1969 leading
                    up to the Gay Liberation movement. The term, ‘Boston
                    Marriage’ was reintroduced by Rothblum and Brehony (1993) to
                    refer to a lesbian relationship that was romantic but was
                    asexual. This could be supported by the fact that women who
                    were in Boston Marriages, had in the past, spoken about why
                    the term marriage was included in this context. For most, it
                    could be explained by the fact that their relationships were
                    nothing short of a kind of union, and for them to ignore
                    that love and devotion would be an insult to their
                    relationships. If we were to put their personalities and
                    relationships in today’s context, it would be fair to call
                    these relationships ‘domestic partnerships’.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    However, there is no true way of knowing if all of these
                    relationships were truly asexual. It also cannot be
                    estimated that all of these women were necessarily lesbian,
                    as there exist other possibilities. Some of them could’ve
                    been placed on the asexual spectrum, some were bisexual and
                    some could’ve easily eliminated gender from their
                    attraction, choosing to love their partner simply because
                    they want to. To term Boston Marriages as examples of
                    lesbian relationships, would be erasure in a lot of
                    different areas and as stated earlier, there is no true way
                    of knowing. Today, the term is used exclusively to signify
                    these historic relationships, to celebrate the union of
                    these women who lived in times that effectively worked
                    against them.

                    This pride month, as we celebrate our own identities, to
                    remember and honour these women and the many other people
                    who have made it possible for us to come this far, is
                    exactly what we should be doing. To keep their stories and
                    memories alive, to keep fighting for equal footing, to be
                    able to express ourselves fully and completely, because, in
                    our path of equality, we still have a long way to go.
