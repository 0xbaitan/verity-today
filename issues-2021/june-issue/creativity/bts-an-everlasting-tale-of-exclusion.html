                    To say that BTS is anything less than legendary, would be to
                    deny the sheer power of their popularity and their impact on
                    the music industry. This year alone, BTS has procured
                    partnerships with McDonald's, Coway, and Kloud. They’re the
                    latest ambassador of Louis Vuitton and have been confirmed
                    to appear on the FRIENDS reunion episode. Along with these
                    feats, BTS is also working on their next album and are
                    preparing to drop their 2nd English single, ‘Butter’.
                    Despite the many accolades that can be attached to the
                    bands’ name, there exists an overwhelming plethora of
                    backlash and criticism, that isn’t even the result of their
                    immense popularity. There has always existed a kind of
                    repulsion since before BTS’ mainstream success that has
                    alienated them in their home industry, and it continues
                    today, now that they have achieved global success.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    BTS was originally planned to be a rap-focused hip-hop group
                    that strayed away from the usual structure of a ‘K-pop
                    group’. BTS modified their image to fit the more
                    conventional K-pop group type with the release of the HYYH
                    album series in 2015, but they refused to leave behind their
                    hip-hop roots and introspective concepts. The crux of the
                    matter is that BTS tried to incorporate the lyric-heavy
                    style of rap into the idol group structure, wherein dancing
                    and visuals were given greater importance. This concept was
                    met with criticism from the K-pop industry dominated by the
                    big three firms (JYP, YG, and SM) as well as the Korean rap
                    community.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    RM, Suga, and J-Hope—the rappers of BTS were the members
                    that upheld this hip-hop image the most. RM was a kind of
                    celebrity in the Korean rap scene, his talent so immense
                    that it prompted Bang Shi-Hyuk (Ceo of BigHit Entertainment)
                    to create an entire group with RM’s image in its midst. When
                    RM left the rap scene, his fellow artists were immensely
                    disappointed at his giving in to the strict ideals of idol
                    life. This backlash from the hip-hop community continued
                    long after BTS’ debut. For example in 2013, mere months
                    after its debut, rapper B-Free slammed BTS for ‘selling out
                    and becoming K-pop artists’. The band was made the subject
                    of mockery in 2014 because of their very name, which
                    translates to ‘Bulletproof Boy Scouts’. Instances of such
                    criticism and mockery in the early years of the band are
                    abundant, however, the rising fame and unstoppability of BTS
                    gradually left the petty voices complaining about trivial
                    things behind.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This brings us to our next topic of scrutiny—the K-pop
                    Industry.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    BTS’ debut stage was filmed as a substitute in the absence
                    of another act. The K-Pop industry refused to treat them as
                    anything of value, giving them the bare minimum, which is
                    sadly, still faced by many groups who aren’t commercially
                    successful. In BTS’ case, however, their success was hardly
                    acknowledged until it was impossible to ignore. After two
                    years of a gradual and organic rise in album sales, BTS
                    dethroned Big Bang in the Hanteo Charts, becoming one of the
                    best-selling artists of 2015. This achievement was
                    immediately heavy speculation that BTS had manipulated
                    charts and of course, they hadn’t. In 2019, there was an
                    influx of artists that had been accused of chart
                    manipulation but once officials stepped in, it was made
                    clear that BTS was indeed one of the only artists who hadn’t
                    resorted to any such means in their entire career.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    From black eyeliner and golden chains, to leather jackets
                    and a more aggressive approach to their topics, BTS evolved
                    to a softer, brighter concept. HYYH was the pinnacle of that
                    and that continued with their ‘Love Yourself' series and
                    ‘Map of the Soul:7’. The kind of masculinity BTS presents is
                    different and honestly, welcoming. The members have shown
                    keen interest in things considered ‘feminine’ and have said
                    that the idea of ‘masculinity’ doesn’t mean much to them.
                    Jimin, in particular, has been the most open about his
                    stylistic choices and presents himself to be extremely
                    ambiguous in stage performances. This reflection and
                    evolution is never acknowledged outside their fan circles.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    BTS faced the overwhelming wrath of xenophobia when they
                    finally started entering the American music industry. These
                    aren't fan observations though, it’s something the members
                    have admitted to while condemning the violence
                    Asian-Americans are facing currently. During an interview,
                    member RM said that the group most often felt like ‘aliens’
                    in the American music industry, and although their success
                    is immense, they’re hardly respected for their artistry.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This year alone, BTS and their culture were mocked on
                    Chilean TV amidst the growing calls to address and stop
                    Asian hate. A German show host compared the band to ‘some
                    crappy virus that will get eradicated soon’, while Topps
                    released stickers showcasing the band members beaten up, all
                    of this in five months. This isn’t new, this mockery was
                    happening last year and the year before, and the year
                    before, and soon enough, you’ll realize that BTS have been
                    facing some or the other kind of exclusion and backlash from
                    some sphere of the music industry.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Today, BTS stands at a position that is not reached by many.
                    They’re the most respected artists in their home country and
                    although the K-pop industry still likes to hoard on their
                    success after excluding them time and time again, BTS
                    members themselves remain unbothered. In the western music
                    industry, however, BTS stands at a place of immense doubt.
                    On one hand, they are far more successful than most artists
                    but on the other hand, they are seldom respected as true
                    artists. Their songwriting or incorporation of the Jungian
                    psychology into their 2020 release ‘Map of the Soul:7’ isn’t
                    widely known, their ‘Love Yourself’ series and the variety
                    of ideas and interpretations of ‘love’ wasn’t acknowledged.
                    It’s the fact that I found more threads on Twitter and
                    Reddit written by fans that give more insight into their
                    creative process and genius than most high-end entertainment
                    articles do. BTS is plagued by the ‘Too mainstream, won’t
                    listen to’ phenomenon, or on the flip side, ‘K-pop is too
                    obscure, ew’ phenomena.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The tale of exclusion on grounds of deconstructed
                    masculinity and Asian origins will go on, unless there is a
                    sudden and drastic change, and when BTS’ turn is over, it’ll
                    be someone else because that’s what this largely bigoted
                    industry does best.
