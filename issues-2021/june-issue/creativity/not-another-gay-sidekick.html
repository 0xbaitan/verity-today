                    Generally considered a mere casual pastime amongst teenagers
                    who live in fantasy worlds more than in reality, fanfiction
                    can be defined as any form of writing that continues,
                    interrupts, or just riffs on stories and characters other
                    people have already written about. Contrary to popular
                    belief, fanfiction has existed for as long as fictional
                    stories. For instance, John Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’ and
                    Dante’s ‘Inferno’ are both classics that are based on the
                    Old Testament and almost all versions of the Arthurian
                    legends are adaptations of a literary work that has existed
                    for several centuries. Modern fanfiction, such as the kind
                    we read online today, is considered to be a separate genre
                    of literature with unique individual storylines that are
                    connected to the original story by way of plot, character,
                    or timeline. However, modern fanfiction is often treated as
                    a dirty word or a shameful child of original popular media.
                    In the year 2019, a popular online fanfiction database,
                    Archive of Our Own (AO3), won a Hugo Award for Best Related
                    Work, an award typically reserved for notable literary or
                    dramatic works of print media and never before given to a
                    website or unpublished work. While all this highlights the
                    relevance and popularity of fanfiction amongst young people
                    today, it is of special significance for the LGBTQ+
                    community. As a genre, fanfiction provides that rare, safe
                    space where LGBTQ+ individuals can explore and own their
                    identity.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While fanfiction may have existed in some form for
                    centuries, the concept of modern fanfiction was popularised
                    by fans of the American TV series ‘Star Trek’, a majority of
                    whom “shipped” the characters Kirk and Spock romantically.
                    While it is likely that this is where fanfiction’s
                    association with homoeroticism began, it is also where
                    fanfiction first started to be negatively associated with
                    lewdness or distastefulness. And it is most definitely not a
                    coincidence that fan-made work became a shallow and
                    frivolous concept the moment a large group of fans started
                    popularising a gay romance, one that would never have
                    canonically been shown on-screen. This pairing, however,
                    popularised fanfiction enough to make it the beginning of
                    the queer community’s aim to make themselves a part of
                    popular culture.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    LGBTQ+ representation, in the modern age, means the
                    portrayal of all non-heterosexual sexual orientations and
                    non-cisgender gender identities in literature and media. But
                    any consumer of entertainment belonging to the LGBTQ+
                    community knows that, while there has been a definite
                    improvement in the last decade or so, there still isn’t
                    nearly enough representation. Fanfiction questions the
                    narrative of dominant mainstream pop culture as a whole as
                    well as the portrayal of heteronormativity and
                    cisnormativity in popular culture by providing a platform
                    for people to publish character-driven stories that may put
                    together any number of characters in various kinds of
                    relationships, irrespective of society’s ‘norms.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The LGBTQ+ representation that we do have in mainstream
                    media is more often than not a heterosexual cisgender
                    person’s attempt at making their work more diverse and
                    progressive. This often leads to representation that is
                    unrealistic and flawed and which inaccurately stereotypes
                    non-heterosexual relationships and non-cisgender people. The
                    gay sidekick stereotype that even more progressive movies,
                    such as ‘To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before’ and ‘Crazy Rich
                    Asians’, adopt often makes people believe that the purpose
                    of knowing a non-heterosexual person is to have a ‘gay best
                    friend’ who can either help boys win over girls or help
                    girls pick out shoes and dresses. A major percentage of
                    fanfiction writers, however, actually belong to the LGBTQ+
                    community and write stories from their own experiences,
                    making it more relatable for all readers belonging to the
                    LGBTQ+ community. Here, queer and trans characters are often
                    the main protagonists going through real-life experiences
                    and living their lives, contrary to popular belief, as
                    ordinarily as any heterosexual cisgender person.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Fanfiction not only represents queerness and queer
                    characters more accurately than most movies and TV shows,
                    but it also brings together a large number of people who
                    have similar interests and love similar characters, thereby
                    forming a community. And due to the anonymity that is
                    provided to most fanfiction writers and readers as a result
                    of it being online, these communities, more often than not,
                    become a safe place for queer individuals to explore their
                    identity. In fact, for those queer people for whom it is
                    hard to come out to family and friends, these online
                    communities become spaces where they can be themselves and
                    receive a lot of support from people who have gone through
                    similar issues.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The world of queer fanfiction, however, is not free of the
                    prejudices that are at play in all other forms of mass
                    media. People of colour, non-cisgender people, people with
                    disabilities, people with mental health issues, and, most
                    importantly, women are largely underrepresented, even in the
                    more progressive world of fanfiction. For instance, records
                    from Archive of Our Own (AO3) show that, as of 2019, 41.9%
                    of total fanfictions are about male homosexual couples,
                    17.6% about heterosexual couples and only 5.8% are about
                    queer females. In the table given below, the first seven
                    pairings, along with many others on the list, are of
                    good-looking white men, making them the symbols of queer
                    fanfiction, as though that is all that queer fanfiction has
                    to offer. This needs to change because we’re no longer
                    living in a time where fanfiction is an unknown, unexplored
                    genre and where characters like Kirk and Spock were first
                    written out of the heteropatriarchy and into a gay space
                    relationship. If white cisgender homosexual men become the
                    symbol of queerness in fanfiction then there really won’t be
                    much progress happening at all. Since a lot of fanfiction is
                    written to include marginalized communities and out of a
                    deep sense of discontent for the exclusive and oppressive
                    media that is more popular, prejudice defeats the purpose of
                    fanfiction which is to challenge authorial intent and take a
                    swipe at the assumption of authority and dogma.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The most empowering thing about fanfiction, however, is that
                    it does not limit its writers. Unlike movies and TV shows
                    that represent the queer community as queer or, fanfiction
                    provides a world where characters can be queer and. They can
                    be queer and happy, queer and carefree, queer and
                    robot-dragon underwater spies, queer and normal. Fanfiction
                    has often been accused of glossing over the realities of
                    homophobia and transphobia. But while it is important to
                    address the oppression and the discrimination faced by queer
                    people, it is also important to normalise queerness. And
                    fanfiction does that by allowing queer individuals to
                    believe that being queer does not necessitate a life of
                    struggle or sorrow, that queer people can have their regular
                    sweet love stories and their happily ever afters as well.
