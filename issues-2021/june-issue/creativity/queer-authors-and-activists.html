                    The LGBTQ+ community has had a very rough history. Today,
                    being a member of this community is illegal in upwards of 70
                    countries. Parts of religious scriptures are often
                    manipulated to justify condemnation of homosexuality. Many
                    riots have taken place for the rights of the LGBTQ+
                    Community and have accomplished various results. This
                    article highlights the creators of LGBTQ+ literature, and
                    activism.

                    Andrew Holleran is the pseudonym of Eric Garber, an American
                    novelist, essayist, and short story writer. He is a
                    prominent novelist of post-Stonewall gay literature. He was
                    a member of The Violet Quill, a gay writer's group that met
                    briefly from 1980-81. His first novel, ‘Dancer from the
                    Dance’ was published in 1978. Its narrative takes place
                    among the discotheques of New York City and Fire Island. For
                    a number of years Holleran taught creative writing at
                    American University in Washington, DC, and he continues to
                    publish short fiction in gay short story collections like
                    M2M: New Literary Fiction and frequently publishes articles

                    Ruth Vanita is an Indian academic, activist and author who
                    specialises in British and Indian literary history with a
                    focus on gender and sexuality studies. Her book, Love's
                    Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West, published in
                    2005, is an analysis of the issues surrounding the
                    recognition of same-sex unions, and the relevance of this
                    debate in democratic societies such as India. Vanita
                    emphasises the history of recognition of same-sex love, and
                    notes that, based on her expert knowledge of ancient Indian
                    texts, same-sex love and relationships are "deeply rooted in
                    Indian culture". The essays focus on pre-colonial, colonial,
                    and post-colonial gay and lesbian life in India to provide a
                    comprehensive look at a much neglected topic.

                    Malinda Lo was born in China and moved to the United States

                    and earned a master's degree in Regional Studies from
                    Harvard. She enrolled at Stanford with the intention of
                    obtaining a PhD in Cultural and Social Anthropology, but
                    left with a second master's degree. Malinda Lo was made a

                    Laurence David Kramer, or Larry Kramer, was an American
                    playwright, author, film producer, public health advocate,
                    and LGBT rights activist. He began his career rewriting
                    scripts while working for Columbia Pictures, which led him
                    to London, where he worked with United Artists. There he
                    wrote the screenplay for the film Women in Love (1969) and
                    received an Academy Award nomination for his work. In 1978,
                    Kramer introduced a controversial and confrontational style
                    in his novel Faggots, which earned mixed reviews and
                    emphatic denunciations from elements within the gay
                    community for Kramer's portrayal of what he characterized as
                    shallow, promiscuous gay relationships in the 1970s. Kramer
                    was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his play The
                    Destiny of Me (1992), and he was a two-time recipient of the
                    Obie Award.

                    Leslie Feinberg, was an American butch lesbian, transgender
                    activist, communist, and author. Feinberg authored Stone
                    Butch Blues in 1993. Her writing, notably Stone Butch Blues
                    and her pioneering non-fiction book 1996's Transgender
                    Warriors, laid the groundwork for much of the terminology
                    and awareness around Gender Studies and was instrumental in
                    bringing these issues to a more mainstream audience.
                    Feinberg began writing in the 1970s. As a member of the
                    Workers World Party, she was the editor of the political
                    prisoners page of the Workers World newspaper for fifteen
                    years, and by 1995, she had become the managing editor.
                    Feinberg's first novel, the 1993 Stone Butch Blues, won the
                    Lambda Literary Award and the 1994 American Library
                    Association Gay & Lesbian Book Award. In Transgender
                    Warriors, Feinberg defines "transgender" as a very broad
                    umbrella, including all "people who cross the cultural
                    boundaries of gender”—including butch dykes, passing women
                    (those who passed as men only in order to find work or
                    survive during war), and drag queens. In June 2019 Feinberg
                    was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers,
                    trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ
                    Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM)
                    in New York City’s Stonewall Inn.
