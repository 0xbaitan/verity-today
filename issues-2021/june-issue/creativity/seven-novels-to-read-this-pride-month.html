                    Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit is a novel by Jeanette
                    Winterson published in 1985 by Pandora Press. It is a
                    coming-of-age story about a lesbian girl who grows up in an
                    English Pentecostal community. Key themes of the book
                    include transition from youth to adulthood, complex family
                    relationships, same-sex relationships, organised religion
                    and the concept of faith.The book is semi-autobiographical
                    and is based on Winterson's life growing up in Accrington,
                    Lancashire. "I wrote about some of these things in Oranges,
                    and when it was published, my mother sent me a furious
                    note". A parallel non-fictional account of her life at this
                    time is given in her 2011 memoir, Why Be Happy When You
                    Could Be Normal? Although the protagonist of Oranges bears
                    the author's first name, John Mullan has argued that it is
                    neither an autobiography nor a memoir, but a Künstlerroman.

                    On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a
                    mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little
                    Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's
                    history that began before he was born — a history whose
                    epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway
                    into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it
                    leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to
                    the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and
                    her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race,
                    class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our
                    American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence,
                    and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On
                    Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of
                    telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating
                    silence of not being heard. With stunning urgency and grace,
                    Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate
                    worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without
                    forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and
                    how to make it a kind of joy, powers the most important
                    debut novel of many years.

                    In Stonewall, renowned historian and activist Martin
                    Duberman tells the full story of this pivotal moment in
                    history. With riveting narrative skill, he re-creates those
                    revolutionary, sweltering nights in vivid detail through the
                    lives of six people who were drawn into the struggle for
                    LGBTQ rights. Their stories combine to form an unforgettable
                    portrait of the repression that led up to the riots, which
                    culminates when they triumphantly participate in the first
                    gay rights march of 1970, the roots of today’s pride
                    marches.

                    Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both
                    an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the
                    story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is
                    not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows
                    them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating
                    divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that
                    the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its
                    structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full
                    self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can
                    begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make
                    peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and
                    unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become
                    women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She
                    Is.

                    From the moment a doctor in Raleigh, North Carolina, put
                    "male" on Jacob Tobia's birth certificate, everything went
                    wrong. Alongside "male" came many other, far less neutral
                    words: words that carried expectations about who Jacob was
                    and who Jacob should be, words like "masculine" and
                    "aggressive" and "cargo shorts" and "sports!". Naturally
                    sensitive, playful, creative, and glitter-obsessed, as a
                    child Jacob was given the label "sissy." In the two decades
                    that followed, "sissy" joined forces with "gay," "trans,"
                    "nonbinary," and "too-queer-to-function" to become a source
                    of pride and, today, a rallying cry for a much-needed gender
                    revolution. Through revisiting their childhood and calling
                    out the stereotypes that each of us have faced, Jacob
                    invites us to rethink what we know about gender and offers a
                    bold blueprint for a healed world--one free from
                    gender-based trauma and bursting with trans-inclusive
                    feminism. Sissy guarantees that you'll never think about
                    gender--both other people's people's and your own--the same
                    way again.

                    A collection of fifteen essays written between 1976 and 1984
                    gives clear voice to Audre Lorde's literary and
                    philosophical personae. These essays explore and illuminate
                    the roots of Lorde's intellectual development and her
                    deep-seated and longstanding concerns about ways of
                    increasing empowerment among minority women writers and the
                    absolute necessity to explicate the concept of
                    difference—difference according to sex, race, and economic
                    status. The title Sister Outsider finds its source in her
                    poetry collection The Black Unicorn (1978). These poems and
                    the essays in Sister Outsider stress Lorde's oft-stated
                    theme of continuity, particularly of the geographical and
                    intellectual link between Dahomey, Africa, and her emerging
                    self.

                    with enormous wit and warmth, All My Mother's Lovers is the
                    exciting debut novel from fiction writer and book critic
                    Ilana Masad. A unique meditation on the universality and
                    particularity of family ties and grief, and a tender and
                    biting portrait of sex, gender, and identity, All My

                    fulfilling relationships.
