                    It’s an age-old story really, the oppressed and the
                    oppressors. The one sided, rather monochrome, dull and
                    stringent understanding of a phenomenon, over-simplifying it
                    for the sake of complacency, gains popularity and boom, one
                    fine day it is on the mouths of every single person and it’s
                    only a matter of time before it turns into documented
                    doctrines and guidelines of socially acceptable behaviour.
                    Of course, there will be minds who are bound to think
                    otherwise and experiment otherwise, only to discover that it
                    feels rather liberating. A segregation is formed with
                    blurred lines, word goes around, the power of the free press
                    takes onto itself and out comes the socially outcasted. Then
                    starts the public humiliation, protests break out in
                    sporadic instances and the next step is only a revolution.
                    It is bound to happen. The revolution that I speak of here,
                    in case of the LGBTQIA+ community, is the Stonewall
                    Uprising.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    You would want to know why it is called the Stonewall
                    Uprising in the first place. The Stonewall Inn was bought by
                    the Genovese crime family in 1966, cheaply rennovated the
                    “straight bar” and reopened it next year as a gay bar. It
                    was a private bottle type of bar since it had no liquor
                    license and required the patrons to carry their own liquor
                    with themselves. The police precinct nearby had been bribed
                    to ignore the activities ongoing within the club. However,
                    Stonewall Inn soon became an important institution in
                    Greenwich Village. Cheap, affordable, allowing dancing - one
                    of the only gay bars left to do so - and welcoming drag
                    queens who otherwise were subject to a rather hostile
                    receipt.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Prior to planned police raids, they used to be tipped off by
                    the corrupt police so that they could put away all the
                    bootlegged alcohol and everything that would be punishable
                    by law. The Inn was raided on the June of 28th, this time
                    the bar having not been tipped. They issued warrants and
                    seized numerous illicit bottles of alcohol and arrested 13
                    people including employees and people who were suspected of
                    not conforming to the law enforced gender appropriate
                    dressing module. The police went as far as to take suspects
                    to the washroom to confirm their assigned sex.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As we have witnessed, time and again, uncalled for
                    degradation, harassment and attacks never make the news or
                    even get publicly acknowledged till the harassed retaliate.
                    Case in point? The farmer’s protest against the farm laws in
                    India and the Israel-Palestine conflict. None of them were
                    spoken about, debated about or even thought about till the
                    oppressed fought back. Same was the case with the Stonewall
                    Riots. Having had enough with the incessant social
                    opprobrium, brutal rousting - at a point a person was hit on
                    the head by an officer while being forced into their police
                    van which incited a violent response from the onlookers in
                    the forms of throwing articles at them - within minutes the
                    area was swarmed with infuriated community members and local
                    residents in hundreds fuelling a full blown riot. Barricades
                    were formed and the police and a few of the prisoners locked
                    themselves within. Attempts were made to breach the
                    barricades and set the Inn on fire. The protest was
                    eventually placated by the riot squad and the flames
                    extinguished but small aftershocks and sometimes riots with
                    thousands of people continued for almost five days. The
                    cause gained traction once the “Village Voice”’s account of
                    the riots was published.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Although the riots were not directly responsible for
                    sparking an intensive movement for LGBTQIA+ rights, it
                    served as a catalyst for an entire new era of political
                    activism as concerned the community. Moreover, it became a
                    binding symbol of solidarity amongst several people from the
                    LGBTQIA+ community. A parade took place on the one-year
                    anniversary of the riot from the Stonewall Inn to Central
                    Park in Manhattan and the official chant of the parade was
                    coined as “Say it loud, gay is proud”. It was a founding
                    stone in the building of protesting several years of overt
                    and covert, subtle and blatant injustice against the
                    LGBTQIA+ community along with a uniting force conflating the
                    cause of feminist movements with opposing the oppression of
                    several other marginalised communities.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The concept is termed as Intersectionality. Now, consider
                    the following scenario: There is a white lesbian woman who
                    experiences discrimnation agaisnt her sexuality. It is the
                    sole cause for multiple fall outs and a bad social image.
                    There is a non-binary pansexual black person who also faces
                    oppression, but on so many different levels. They lose job
                    opportunities and are mistrusted as a capable person on
                    multiple occasions. Their gender identity is a source of
                    confusion for several people owing to the lack of education
                    about this and is invalidated by several transphobes. They
                    are misgendered continuously and their sexuality is also
                    dismissed and a fake sexuality by ignorant people of their
                    own community. Their oppression sources from their race,
                    gender identity as well as sexuality, while the other woman
                    faces oppression sourcing from only her sexuality. In no
                    circumstances can they ever be equal levels of oppression,
                    quite clearly. Let us look at it from the opposite point of
                    view. The white woman was more privileged than the other
                    person. Accepting that everyone faces different levels of
                    oppression and acknowledging that it comes from privilege in
                    certain areas of life and identifying all the overlapping
                    factors that lead to discrimination agaisnt an individual is
                    what Intersectioanlity is. That is precisely why I mentioned
                    feminist movements there.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In talking about the Stonewall Riots one must acknowledge
                    the scope left in its wake for creating a community space
                    that is more inclusive and that breaks the hegemony of white
                    skinned, upper-caste gay men and lesbian women who often
                    conciously and unconciously engage in the erasure of the
                    history trans bodies and the histories of
                    non-heteronormative non-white queer narratives. The
                    conflation of intersectionality is an important tool of
                    measuring the worth of feminism in academia and in practise
                    now but this should also by extension be applied to the
                    social work being done in the field of queer communities. If
                    a movement spearheaded to save the marginalised ends up
                    making hierarchies within its own community, then this
                    process of double discrimination should be called out
                    vehemently. To fight the oppressors the oppressed must be
                    united and thence is born the legacy of the Stonewall Riots,
                    consolidating protests as the only method of effective
                    opposition against systemic oppression and serving as an
                    internationally recognised linchpin of strength for the
                    community.
