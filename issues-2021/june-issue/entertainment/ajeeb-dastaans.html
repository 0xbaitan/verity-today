                    What is the special attraction of the four-film anthology?
                    There is the trilogy of Bombay Talkies, Lust Stories and
                    Ghost Stories. And then, in the last year, Netflix and Prime
                    have produced at least four more. I think it’s the idea that
                    the films will have variety without being so varied as to be
                    collectively forgettable. There were eighteen films in
                    Paris, je t’aime, for instance, and I remember none well
                    except faint flashes of the one starring Natalie Portman. 
                    The latest in this parade is Dharma Productions, awkwardly
                    titled Ajeeb Daastaans. A word about that title. How exactly
                    do we pronounce it? Is the n nasal or not? I guess it
                    doesn’t matter because the English plural grafted onto the
                    Hindi noun just never escapes its awkwardness. There are
                    four films here, directed by Shashank Khaitan, Raj Mehta,
                    Neeraj Ghaywan and Kayoze Irani. The films have little in
                    common, apart from the fact that they all end in unexpected
                    places – two are outright ‘twists’, two are simply
                    unanticipated closings. A closer look at the title might
                    force us into a queer reading of the same for two of the
                    four films deal with queer themes while another prominently
                    has its narrative around the issue of speech disability. The
                    queer angle is of particular interest to me because if my
                    memory serves me right, the Karan Johar short in Bombay
                    Talkies too was titled “Ajeeb dastan hai yeh” and dealt with
                    a closeted and married gay man in Bombay.

                    Khaitan’s short is called Majnu and is the most theatrical,
                    albeit ridiculous, of the lot. Jaideep Ahlawat, deeply
                    deeply miscast, stars as Babloo, the scion of a landed
                    family somewhere in North India who, on his wedding night,
                    informs his young bride Lipakshi (a positively now being
                    typecast Fatima Sana Shaikh) that he will not be able to
                    commit to their marriage fully. He has married because he
                    was forced to, but he is still in love with someone else.
                    And he wants to punish his father by not producing an heir,
                    so he will not consummate the marriage either.

                    The Indian Constitution guarantees the universal adult
                    franchise as a fundamental right to every Indian citizen
                    above the age of 18. Yet, five people were killed at a
                    polling booth in Sitalkuchi on 10th April, 2021. Reports of
                    repeated bombings in front of people’s houses in villages,
                    death threats to voters and confiscation of Voter ID cards
                    are all examples of how political parties are trying to
                    discourage civilians from voting by inducing violence and
                    fear in an attempt to prevent the balance from tipping in
                    favour of the opposition.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    What follows is a naughty little story that, upon
                    reflection, is actually pretty tragic, but because this is a
                    short film, it’s hideously rushed, making it less upsetting
                    than it might have been if the relationships had been
                    allowed to blossom fully in feature length. There’s a lot of
                    plot here: a young man Lipakshi sets her eyes on (Armaan
                    Ralhan), a deeply buried secret, revenge for long-ago
                    wrongs, duplicity, and, of course, love and lust. It’s
                    perhaps the most Bollywood of the films, the most grandiose.
                    Khaitan’s heartland stories have become twistier and tougher
                    to deal with since his instantly likeable debut, Humpty
                    Sharma ki Dulhania. Majnu packs in so much – there are
                    actually two twists – that it can feel kind of contrived and
                    pulpy in terms of aesthetics at the best. I definitely saw
                    the first twist coming. Is it gimmicky? Yes. Can it be said
                    for the closing two minutes of the film too? Hell yes!
                    However, despite its operatic grandiose, it’s a well-made
                    film, and it’s entertainingly told. And it’s also clever:
                    the twist made me revisit some of the earlier dialogue in a
                    new light. For instance, Babloo tells Lipakshi on their
                    wedding night that if he had had his way, ‘aapki jagah koi
                    aur hota.’ Later, this particular choice of words began to
                    make a different kind of sense. The next film is Raj Mehta’s
                    Khilauna. This film is structured as a whodunnit, but an
                    interesting one: the actual crime is just as much a mystery
                    as who committed it. There is a back-and-forth structure
                    that contrasts the police investigation in the present with
                    the sequence of events in the past. Nushrratt Bharuccha
                    (once again, I have not misspelt this) is a housemaid named
                    Meenal who works hard to put her much-younger sister (the
                    very talented Inayat Verma) through school. Meenal also has
                    a maybe-maybe-not sexual relationship with the local
                    istrivaala Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee). The three of them go
                    up against their employers, who live in a high-rise.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The title is a metaphor: in the capitalist dog-eat-dog
                    world, everybody is a khilauna (toy) for someone else. The
                    rich want to use the poor, the poor want to use the rich.
                    Even familial relationships are not free of personal-gain
                    machinations, this film wants to tell us. This last comes
                    through in the closing twist – but while the motivation is
                    clear, the twist itself is totally unconvincing. It’s a case
                    of the writer (Sumit Saxena, who has writing credits on all
                    but one of the films) trying to be too clever- trying
                    insanely hard to pull off a Roald Dahl- and unfortunately it
                    feels so fake and forced. Also, the reveal comes from one of
                    Meenal’s employers and...how did she know? I don’t know.
                    It’s the makers sacrificing coherence for shock value, which
                    on the other hand lands positively because I doubt any
                    viewer will easily forget the image of a pressure cooker
                    spewing blood - yes you heard me right. The third film is
                    Neeraj Ghaywan’s Geeli Pucchi, which means ‘wet kiss’. This
                    is a most unusual film from a most unusual filmmaker. The
                    protagonist is Bharti Mandal (Konkona Sensharma in a role
                    that finally pushes her acting chops thoroughly after so
                    long), a queer Dalit woman – which means three separate
                    strains of marginalisation. Sensharma loses herself in this
                    character, getting the walk and mannerisms just right, and
                    letting Bharti’s hurt cross her face in just the right
                    amounts. Bharti works in a factory and hopes for the job of
                    a data collector, but this goes to Priya Sharma (Aditi Rao
                    Hydari, who is both beautiful and terrific). What are
                    Priya’s advantages? Well, she is Brahmin.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The film is not subtle about its characters’ castes. One of
                    Bharti’s co-workers, Dashrath, tells her that her surname is
                    Mandal, not Banerjee, and that that should make it clear to
                    her that she’ll never have Priya’s job. Later, the film is
                    not subtle about Bharti’s queerness either: she watches a
                    video of her old girlfriend, in which she kisses her. These
                    are interesting decisions because the film’s climax (the
                    ‘twist’, if you will, which is more an
                    I-didn’t-see-this-coming) is very subtle. I thought about it
                    a lot: but why? But why would she…? But how could she…? And
                    I realise that I have an urban, caste-blind view myself: I
                    don’t see the centuries of continued oppression that Bharti
                    does, I don’t feel the sting of losing a job simply because
                    of my surname, and my self-worth doesn’t therefore depend on
                    my career security. When films place the marginalised in the
                    centre, there is often a desire to portray them as good and
                    valorous, or as suffering victims. Hollywood films are rife
                    with the ‘bury your gays’ trope: films about queer lives
                    often end with them dying and eliciting our sympathy. But in
                    Geeli Pucchi, Ghaywan is not trying to pump sympathy out of
                    us. In fact, he doesn’t want us to project emotions onto the
                    screen, but rather to evaluate our own in-built
                    caste-related biases, and our understanding of the
                    intersection of identities.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    A sweet and tentative romance develops between Priya and
                    Bharti (and a lovely song plays over their time together),
                    but when Priya’s mother-in-law tells her to be careful about
                    her friendships because her father-in-law is going to be a
                    mahant soon, we know this relationship is doomed. What,
                    Ghaywan and Saxena ask, is important to someone who faces
                    the levels of discrimination that Bharti does? Every day,
                    she goes up against Brahmanical patriarchy. Every day, her
                    ‘manly’ clothes and rough exterior render her – tragically –
                    vulnerable to her co-workers’ taunts. Every day, she is
                    reminded that even if she has accepted her own queerness,
                    the world around her is so innately homophobic that any
                    romantic attachment she forms comes with more than a tinge
                    of uncertainty. In such a world, in such a life, is it
                    surprising that Bharti resorts to any means to hold on to
                    the one thing that gives her stability: her career? This
                    definitely will be one of the most talked about films of the
                    year but having seen Juice I only wish Ghaywan had been
                    tighter in his editing. That is not saying that I did not
                    like this film. For me it will always be a close second to
                    Juice and Masaan (I am sorry I cannot choose between those
                    two masterpieces and you shall rot in hell if you make me
                    choose too).

                    The last film of the anthology is Ankahi, directed by
                    debutant Kayoze Irani. I weirdly enough loved this film.
                    It’s probably because it’s the easiest of the four to like
                    and Irani constructs it beautifully. It tells the story of
                    Natasha (Shefali Shah is, of course, devastatingly good),
                    the mother of a teenager (Sara Arjun) who is going deaf.
                    Natasha has learnt sign to speak to her daughter, but her
                    husband Rohan ( an as usual stiff Tota Roy Choudhury) is too
                    busy trying to get the girl a cochlear implant to learn sign
                    language.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And then Natasha forms a tender relationship with a
                    photographer (Manav Kaul finally as a swoon-worthy romantic
                    lead), who is also deaf. Kaul and Shah are simply two of the
                    best actors in Hindi movies and it is a wonder to me that
                    nobody has cast them together before. In the space of this
                    small film, and with no spoken dialogue, they create a
                    tangible chemistry with their hands and their eyes.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Ankahi is about fleeting moments, things recognised but
                    unsaid, and how important truth and communication are to
                    relationships. But it doesn’t beat you on the head with
                    these musings: they are merely hinted at before the film
                    comes to a close with a scene where Kaul and Shah tell each
                    other things they never say.It is likely Ankahi will leave
                    some viewers unsatisfied – where is the closure? What is the
                    future of these connections and communications? True to the
                    film’s title, Irani leaves these questions unanswered. But
                    this is what the short film format allows – an exploration
                    of a situation or a relationship, without the burden of
                    character arcs or conflict and resolution or beginning,
                    middle and end. Ankahi simply is.

                    Ajeeb Daastaans is long at two hours and twenty-two minutes.
                    But the films themselves rarely feel stretched – and, of
                    course, you can go away in between the shorts and come back.
                    Like all anthologies, some of the films will hold up better
                    on close examination and others are enjoyable only when
                    viewed from a distance (the less we try to unpack Karan
                    Johar’s horror short in Ghost Stories, for instance, the
                    better although I will guiltily admit to loving its absurd
                    sense of humour) But I definitely some of these, even if
                    they feed less into each other than I would have liked. I
                    will be thinking about them, especially Geeli Puchhi and
                    Ankahi.
