                    I had been in a superb quandary, regarding the composition
                    of this article. At first I had considered the idea of
                    composing it prior to the Academy Awards, analysing the
                    nominees and serving my, quite unwarranted, opinion on who
                    will - and who should - win. Considering the eyebrows the
                    former option would have raised among most, (I mean why
                    should the matter of an opinionated, unqualified, nineteen
                    year old matter) I decided it would be safer to make public
                    my opinions, after the ceremony had been conducted. Not that
                    this article is going to be any less lacking in my many
                    opinions and views, but you get the drill. In this breakdown
                    of the 93rd Academy Awards we shall be looking at some of
                    the important competitive categories, in the order that they
                    were announced in what will go down as one of the shortest
                    albeit personal events in Oscar history.

                    <i>Promising Young Woman</i> had a shot to leave a mark only
                    in this and the Best Actress category. Despite being the
                    first time in Academy history when two female directors were
                    nominated together, Fennel hardly stood a chance before
                    Zhao, on whose brilliance we will talk later. This year by
                    far saw one of the toughest Best Actress categories in a
                    long time, where Carrey Mulligan was once again up against
                    career best performances by all her fellow nominees. Which
                    left the original screenplay category. Fennel was up against
                    screenwriting genius Aaron Sorkin, who had written the
                    screenplay of his crowd favourite
                    <i>Trial of the Chicago 7</i>. Sorkin is a writing genius
                    and despite the rousing quality of his film, which strangely
                    reeked of classic masala Hindi cinema tropes, it hardly
                    matched up to his masterpiece <i>The Social Network</i>. In
                    front of it, the searing panache and radical thought behind
                    Fennel’s debut deserved to be awarded for its sheer
                    originality of a long indulged stereotype and a narrative
                    that assumes special importance in the post - Me too world.

                    Most people expected, going by precedents, that the lack of
                    a story thereof will earn Nomadland a win in this category
                    too. But what most failed to realise was that Nomadland was
                    more a product of a glorious directorial vision than had
                    little, according to me to do with writing. The narrative
                    was heavily reliant on moods, visuals and feelings as
                    opposed to narrative. Which correctly justifies the decision
                    of the Academy to vote Florian Zeller as the winner in this
                    category. The risk with making a film based on a play is
                    that the translation of theatre into celluloid is most often
                    not smooth. Due to the vastly different lexicons that grow
                    behind the construction of the genre one often risks making
                    a film that at best looks stilted and at worst looks, for
                    the lack of a better word - staged. Zeller overcomes both
                    these possibilities and in The Father, offers us one of the
                    finest depictions of old age, dementia and the effects of
                    decaying memory that renders an individual incapable of
                    distinguishing between truth and imagination. Not only was
                    the narrative engaging but the dialogues heartbreakingly
                    Zeller a fitting winner of this award.

                    I know what I am about to say is terribly controversial but
                    despite sharing similar subject matters, Judas and the Black
                    Messiah was a far, far, far better film than Trial Of
                    Chicago 7. There was nothing, new per se about the latter
                    that we hadn’t seen before. The climactic stretch was
                    definitely goosebump inducing but what else? Judas imbued
                    layers of complexity to a tale often told and hence this
                    category, despite a surprise nomination for Paul Reci, was a
                    head to head between Cohen and Kaluyaa. I would have been
                    terribly upset had Cohen won this category because let’s
                    face it, in a year where the sequel to Borat released,
                    awarding Sacha Baron Cohens’ acting chops on the basis of
                    his portrayal of a hippie rebel hardly makes sense. Moreover
                    Kaluyaa, of Get Out fame, had brought to his performance a
                    rare vulnerability imbued with stony surface grit. Many
                    might say this award comes too early in his career, but I
                    say this shall mark the beginning of what I feel is a
                    remarkable career of many more such complex portrayals and
                    performances from one of the most promising young stars of
                    this generation.

                    Glenn Close being nominated for the excruciatingly ordinary
                    Hillbilly Elegy, is all you need to know about the
                    compensatory nature of the Academy Awards. Many, I included,
                    thought the Academy might actually go ahead and finally
                    award the woman for a change. But then she was up against
                    the genre bending performance of Maria Bakalova, the
                    luminescent presence of Amanda Seyfried (an early award
                    favourite), the devastatingly beautiful Olivia Colman who
                    said it all with her eyes and finally Youn Yuh-jung. As the
                    chatty grandmother in the poignant immigrant drama Minari,
                    she won the hearts of one and all with largely identifiable
                    trial of trying to fit into a culture that is shockingly
                    alien. There was humour, warmth and a large dollop of pathos
                    in that performance and no matter what our favourites were
                    in this category, there is not a single person today who
                    begrudges her this win. Be careful to look out for her
                    hilarious yet strikingly scathing acceptance speech, one of
                    the most definitive highlights of the evening.

                    Guess who won the award? Chloe Zhao. <br />
                    Having already swept every single award for direction this
                    season, this category was a no brainer as Zhao became the
                    second woman and first Asian woman in Oscar history to
                    receive this honour. The history notwithstanding, the
                    significance of the moment was not lost on anyone as it was
                    Bong Joon-ho who presented her with the award. Many critics
                    have argued that Zhao has works that are even more stunning
                    in their brilliance, but that does subtract from the fact
                    that Nomadland is a testament to the importance of
                    directorial vision and capacity in telling a story. The film
                    hardly has a story per se. It operates mostly on visuals, a
                    towering performance and the ability of its director to keep
                    you invested in the story of the protagonist by evoking
                    succinct moods and visuals. No matter how good a
                    performance, how good a script or how brilliant the edit, it
                    all finally comes down to the leap of faith that the vision
                    of the director is willing to chase. And by god, in this
                    film it landed!

                    Ever since the Venice Film Festival, Nomadland too has been
                    sweeping all best picture awards this season. But
                    considering the Academy has in the past gone ahead and
                    awarded Crash over Brokeback Mountain and Green Book over
                    Roma, one would do good to harbour doubts that this year too
                    maybe the Academy ended up splitting the awards for director
                    and film. I would have howled my lungs out had Mank won, but
                    according to most pundits it was a call between the
                    poignancy of Minari, the esoteric brilliance of Nomadland,
                    the radical originality of Promising Young Woman and the
                    rousing crowd favourite Trial of the Chicago 7. The latter
                    undoubtedly is a memorable film and the Academy could have
                    very well offered the highest honour of the night to it, but
                    to the satisfaction of everyone the crown landed on the
                    deserving heads of Nomadland. Nomadland in my opinion is
                    most definitely one of the most astounding pieces of cinema
                    to have come out of America. In its depiction of the eroding
                    American Dream and search of identity and belonging in the
                    face of loss it is parable of our times - so deeply
                    resonating and universal that it makes any and every viewer
                    to reflect on its quiet commentary on modern day loneliness.
                    I also sincerely hope that this win opens the eyes of the
                    average American movie consumer to the beauty of works of
                    auteurs like Zhao who, till now had only been only a name in
                    the festival circuit.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This was perhaps the most difficult category to select from
                    this year. But also at the same time as far as the actresses
                    go, this has been a truly weirdly amazing award season. I
                    mean just take for example, Vanessa Kirby won the Volpi Cup,
                    Andra Day surprised everyone with her Golden Globe win,
                    Carey Mulligans’ big risk paid off with a Critics Choice
                    win, Viola Davis stunned with a SAG win and finally Frances
                    McDormand won the BAFTA for her role as the grieving Fern.
                    All these performances were in their own right career best
                    performances of the actresses in question. Mulligan's
                    success was largely due to the spot on casting - her
                    porcelain doll face not betraying the sinister sociopathic
                    tendencies lurking underneath her skin while Viola Davis did
                    stun everyone with her rendition of Ma Rainey (I personally
                    still maintain her best is Doubt where she stole the entire
                    film from Hoffman, Adams and Streep in the matter of exactly
                    ten minutes). But if I was given the choice I would have
                    personally handed over the statuette to Kirby for the sheer
                    physicality demonstrated in her performance and that
                    devastating one-take opening sequence. Obviously her win
                    suffered its setback owing to the Shia Labeouf controversy
                    and I was initially harbouring mixed feelings about the
                    Frances Mcdormand win. However on reflection, the choice
                    does not seem too out of place considering that Nomadland is
                    first a character study, a portrait of sorts, that through
                    its many shades attempts to offer its commentary not just on
                    loss and loneliness but what it truly means to be and belong
                    to America today. And with this McDormand, a powerhouse
                    performer from day one (her winning range includes a black
                    comedy, a tale of revengeful grief and now a quiet quest for
                    identity) ties with Meryl Streep and Daniel Day Lewis to
                    have the second highest number of Oscars for acting.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Now this is the most juicy bit of the Oscars this year. The
                    moment the Best Picture announcement preceded the ones for
                    Best Actor and Actress, everyone knew the producers were
                    hoping for Chadwick Boseman to win the award posthumously
                    and end the event of a note of emotional crescendo. Their
                    hopes were not unfounded for, according to me, on grounds of
                    sole sentimentality Boseman had been sweeping the award
                    season for his excellent turn in Ma Rainey. His legacy is
                    one that needs to be honoured for he truly is a talent lost
                    early. But that said this had been the year of Riz Ahmed for
                    his astonishing performance in Sound of Metal, till The
                    Father released and Sir Hopkins came with all guns blazing.
                    At 83 he is the oldest man to win an acting Oscar and his
                    performance in The Father is perhaps one of the singularly
                    greatest performances of the past decade. The physicality of
                    it, its unassuming attention to the minutest of details and
                    its portrayal of emotional complexity in a dialogue driven
                    narrative is going to be studied for years in acting schools
                    across the world. I had been silently praying that by some
                    miracle he ends up winning the award and my prayers did get
                    answered tonight, although I think the BAFTAs too had a huge
                    role to play in this. I do feel sorry for Ahmed. I truly do
                    because this was his hour to shine. But I hope fate grants
                    him one more chance to prove his talent because despite the
                    absence of the closure of an acceptance speech from Hopkins,
                    this was a performance by a genius that needed to be
                    awarded, that needed to be acknowledged for its devastating
                    beauty. Just watch out the last scene where he breaks down
                    while holding onto a postcard from his daughter. You wont
                    know if it is real life or acting. You just cannot. And that
                    is, perhaps the greatest feat of this performance.
