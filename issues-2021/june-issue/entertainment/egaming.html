                    One whole year of this pandemic and now we are back to
                    square one- schools closed, exams cancelled and a lot of us
                    have all the time in the world to waste on whatever we want
                    to (I however strongly recommend not doing this for obvious
                    reasons). But these days have been reminding me of the days
                    exactly a year ago when I could have been studying and
                    finishing my syllabus for my board exam that was supposed to
                    occur after school would apparently reopen in June or some
                    month. Instead, I wasted my time experimenting games that
                    were my entire life back in the day to see if they could
                    have possibly filled the void in me that had been created
                    owing to isolation. Nah, I’m just kidding, my situation was
                    not that bad, like I’m pretty sure a lot of us were facing
                    similar problems as I was always told by my friends and
                    family that I was “not alone”.

                    Anyways, I’m positive I’m not the only one who approached
                    video games to kill time, and before I proceed, I just want
                    to clarify that I am NOT a gamer and I can’t play most games
                    to save my life and I am also uneducated as to what the
                    different games are and all that information, you know what
                    I mean. As a kid all I would play was Club Penguin, Fantage
                    and Moshi Monsters. They were all virtual world games with
                    maps and avatars and shops and pets, name it and you’d find
                    it there. You’d be able to role play there and basically do
                    basically whatever you wanted as long as it was family
                    friendly of course. Well unfortunately each one of these
                    three games shut down for various reasons so I couldn’t
                    revisit those even though I really wished to do so, but I
                    had to play my games and sure did I compromise by trying a
                    new game.

                    So, the games I tried out were Roblox and Club Penguin
                    Rewritten. If you don’t know what Club Penguin Rewritten is,
                    its basically a fan made version of the original Club
                    Penguin which you could still play until January 1st 2021 if
                    I’m not wrong, it isn’t exactly the same but it’s a pretty
                    good substitute for the original, especially if you wish to
                    go back to the site for the sake of nostalgia! Best part is
                    that you don’t need to pay for membership as it is free, so
                    I basically was able to do all that I wanted to do as a kid
                    as I never had membership back then. It was pretty nice
                    playing the game as most of the people I saw on the game
                    were high school and college students visiting the website
                    to revisit old memories, I understand why because it must’ve
                    been a nice way to spend free time among the academic
                    pressure for them, I’d say the same for me but I didn’t seem
                    like I was under pressure back then (yes, I know it was
                    quite alarming).

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And now going onto Roblox- this is a game I played when I
                    was actually under pressure and honestly, I don’t even know
                    why I played it- none of my friends played it and I barely
                    played it as a kid myself. But it was also quite interesting
                    playing it as there are SO MANY games to choose from- from
                    roleplay games, to parkour games, to tycoons, and even games
                    where one can get free therapy(??) (I do not suggest joining
                    free therapy games especially if you genuinely need
                    therapy). So, you know- name it and you will find it on
                    Roblox. For me personally, I go onto Roblox mainly for the
                    parkour games(obbys) and in contrary to popular belief that
                    these parkour games stress you out to the max, I think they
                    rather helped me with my stress and I would play them during
                    my breaks in between studies and it was well- somehow
                    calming. I really had no clue playing these games would be
                    of any use to me and considering that I had barely even
                    played Roblox before I was positive that I would give up on
                    the game within at most a month from when I started playing
                    but I guess I was wrong and I am not mad about it either.
                    So, if you ever feel stressed out you should try playing
                    some parkour game- it may not be on Roblox but just try it
                    out to see if you’re an apparent psychopath like me for
                    finding your calm in these games.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Playing games for whatever reason is indeed very fun but
                    obviously just like anything that provides with
                    entertainment, you will have to moderate your time spent on
                    it because you obviously don’t want to get addicted to
                    playing something on a screen which you’re on almost 24/7
                    owing to school and basically everything being online. Let’s
                    pray that the COVID-19 situation in India gets better so
                    that we can start going out and start meeting people instead
                    of having to depend on online games for our happiness which
                    isn’t all bad- but isn’t really the most desirable. Stay
                    safe!
