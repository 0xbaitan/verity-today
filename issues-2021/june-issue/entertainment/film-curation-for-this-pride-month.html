                    Here are five lesser-known films from the canon of queer
                    cinema to watch and appreciate this Pride month. The list is
                    not exclusive and has been curated on the basis of personal

                    1. A Single Man
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Directed by one of the biggest names in American fashion,
                    Tom Ford, this largely sepia drenched ode to beauty and
                    mortality seems like a fashion commercial stretched to 90
                    minutes. If there is any film which has explored the gaze of
                    a man and its yearning for beauty, then it is this. Based on
                    the eponymous novel by Christopher Isherwood, this movie
                    follows a day in the life of Professor Falconer, who decides
                    to kill himself being unable to cope with the loneliness
                    following the death of his 16-year long lover, here played
                    by Matthew Goode. The novel never really makes an issue out
                    of the sexuality of the characters. It is just as
                    commonplace a thing as the cigarettes they smoke and the
                    cars they drive in. Early on the film it is even laid bare
                    that Falconer had slept with his now best-friend Charley
                    while they were kids in London. Colin Firth as Falconer
                    gives the performance of a lifetime. This is a film that
                    explores grief, not in its loud outpouring but in its
                    infinite, yet measured silences and Firth makes every beat
                    clear through effective use of his eyes and body language.
                    His interactions with his student, played by a brilliant
                    Nichoulas Hoult, exhibits no lust but a yearning for the
                    youth and love that he has now lost forever. This film, in
                    its deeply Mrs. Dalloway-esque style of narrative is one of
                    the best navigations of the mundanity that governs the queer
                    experience, defined mostly in languages of heartbreak. Watch
                    out for an electric performance by Julianne Moore, who in a
                    brief supporting act, almost threatens to steal the film.

                    2. The Handmaiden
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Directed by Korean auteur Park-Chan Wook, this erotic
                    thriller is a crazy mix of beauty, violence and sex - all
                    trademarks of some of the best works of Wook. In this
                    adaptation of Fingersmith by Sarah Waters, he transports a
                    scintillating lesbian love story of deception and violence
                    from high-brow Victorian England to Korea under Japanese
                    invasion. The period setting allows him to imbue this dark
                    thriller with a sense of visual beauty that is so hard to
                    dismiss that one is almost forced to look the violence,
                    psychological and physical, directly in the eye. The film
                    follows the story of a con-man, known as Count Fujiwara,
                    employing the help of a rookie thief called Soo-ke to entrap
                    and steal the inheritance of a wealthy noblewoman Lady
                    Hideko. Soo-ke is made to pose as the lady’s handmaiden
                    while Count Fujiwara tries to court her and win her
                    affection. Trouble arises when Soo-kee falls in love with
                    Lady Hideko, complicating the execution of the operation -
                    but very soon we learn that all is not at all what it seems.
                    The queerness of the character is hardly an issue in the
                    film. It is something that just is. Their love story blooms
                    with the commonplace nature of any heterosexual nature and
                    that is one of the standing achievements of the film. By
                    normalising the romance between its leading women, the film
                    goes ahead with its complex plot of family trauma, violence,
                    double-deception and sex, giving rise to one of the finest
                    queer romanctic-thrillers of the last decade.

                    3. The Normal Heart
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    An often overlooked film about the ravages of the AIDS
                    epidemic in America and how it affected the queer community
                    this film stars an eviable ensemble cast of actors including
                    the likes of Julia Roberts, Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer and Jim
                    Parsons. Although the couple at the center of the film is
                    Felix and Ned, the film instead of focussing just on their
                    personal travails takes a larger aerial look at the problems
                    of the queer community that furthered the spread of the
                    epidemic. The film has a feel-good sense to it and the
                    screenplay though fast paced and unwavering in its focus
                    does tug at our heartstrings just at the right moments. The
                    moments are designed to play out as melodrama but the pitch
                    of the performances never becomes operatic, lending a sense
                    of stability and sophistication to the film. But this
                    popularly termed divisive nature of a film like this does
                    not really interfere with character development or narrative
                    progression because of the genuine feeling with which every
                    character is written. We understand the anxieties of Ned,
                    Dr. Brooks one sided fight against the system and finally,
                    in a few seconds watch Jim Parsons, whose ability to play
                    “serious” characters is criminally underrated go from
                    sadness to dejection to heart breaking acceptance in the
                    final scene of the film.

                    4. Memories in March
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The second installment of the queer trilogy helmed by
                    bengali auteur and queer icon Rituparno Ghosh, this chamber
                    drama starring Deepti Naval, Raima Sen and Ghosh himself is
                    a masterclass in writing and performance. Directed by Sanjoy
                    Nag, this is the only film on this list where the sexuality
                    of a character becomes a cause of conflict. A mother comes
                    to her son’s work city following his death and realises that
                    there is more to his life as an executive in an advertising
                    agency than she was ever privy to. In one of the most moving
                    sequences of the film, Ghosh playing the lover of the
                    deceased man, asks the grieving mother played by Naval, that
                    what was a greater concern for her, the death of her own son
                    or the knowledge that he was gay. This forms the emotional
                    crux of the film making it a riveting watch as one keeps
                    guessing if the two strangers, who had been brought together
                    in ways unknown long before destiny brought them together,
                    choose to be united by their shared grief or part ways by
                    their vastly divided memories.

                    5. The Favourite
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    There are many reasons to watch what is arguably one of the
                    best films of Greek master Yorgos Lanthimos, the foremost
                    being the performance of Olivia Colman. Shattering in her
                    portrayal of Queen Anne, this film is a delicious lesbian
                    love traingle set against the excess and intrigue of the
                    early 18th Century English court. It follows the rivalry
                    between Lady Sarah Marlborough played by a wicked Rachel
                    Weiz and Lady Abigail played by the stone-cold Emma Stone as
                    they vie for the affections of the Queen. What begins as
                    petty rivalry eventually turns into an acerbic cat and mouse
                    chase as the two women go to extreme lengths to win the
                    favour of the ailing queen. Lanthimos has always had an eye
                    for the macabre and his ability to elicit comedy from the
                    most upsetting of scenarios is a testament to the sheer
                    genius of the man. But even as the film follows a constant
                    power struggle, against the backdrop of court politics, the
                    narrative causes us to reflect deeply on pertinent questions
                    like the true nature of love and who is a better lover - one
                    who chooses to lie and say with genuine comfort that the
                    beloved looks like an angel fallen from heaven or another
                    whose loyalty, despite being fierce, is also cruel enough to
                    comment that the beloved looks nothing short of an ugly
                    badger.
