                    Before anything else, let us acknowledge what Ryan Murphy
                    has done, in the past few years with the narration of queer
                    stories and voices in cinema and television. A queer
                    television mogul, he invested his money behind critically
                    acclaimed shows like <i>Pose</i> featuring a spectacular
                    cast comprising trans and queer men and women of colour
                    alongside rebooting the film adaptation of popular Broadway
                    show <i>Boys in the Band</i>, led by a largely queer cast
                    facing off against each other in a chamber drama that
                    explored with authenticity and feeling the dynamics of what
                    went behind the construction of queer relations in our
                    society. His deeply queer aesthetic of bright and dazzling
                    colours, as evident from his earlier ventures such as the
                    popular <i>Glee</i>
                    and the more recent The Prom do not undermine his capacity
                    to dig up the darkness of queer psyche in yet again
                    critically lauded The Assassination of Giani Versace. One of
                    his latest ventures, a fantastical reimagining of Hollywood
                    in the wake of the ravages of WW2 were laid with noble
                    intentions (Rock Hudson with a Black male lover, an Asian
                    American yesteryear actress winning an Oscar and a Black
                    woman front lining a major studio production) spearheaded by
                    a powerful ensemble - was heavily let down by a
                    broad-stroked screenplay lacking narrative depth.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    On the back of this, his latest Netflix-produced, five-part
                    web series on famous American fashion designer Halston
                    (played by an eclectic Ewan Mcgregor) was something that was
                    highly anticipated. Halston has always been one of the most
                    controversial figures in American fashion and although his
                    is one of the standing legacies in the American scene, his
                    life has never really been utilised for dramatisation. After
                    all the story has the makings of everything that Murphy
                    loves so much - the dazzling fabrics and colours of New York
                    couture in the late 1900s, the trauma of childhood, the heat
                    of lusty relationships, the navigations of art and commerce,
                    and above all, drugs and rock and roll. And I say with great
                    pleasure that Murphy delivers in what is one of the most
                    ridiculously watchable and impeccably pulpy Netflix
                    originals I have seen in a long, long while.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The story begins not with the childhood of Halston. Instead,
                    it gives us glimpses of the same. His unwavering bond with
                    his mother, his initial inspirations growing up in a
                    suburban American county far removed the dizzying world of
                    glamorous New York, an abusive family - trauma that he
                    carries on with himself for the rest of his life. All these
                    cornerstones in his character are given tidy little arcs
                    throughout the series, and end up serving as pivotal and in
                    one case life-altering moments in his life. He lands us
                    instead, in the middle of the scene where Halston, under the
                    name of Bergdorf Goodman has already made a name for himself
                    as the creator of the Kennedy pillbox hat, and is yearning
                    day and night to make a separate identity for himself as a
                    designer of clothes.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The first hour and a half underlines the beginning of his
                    relationship with Liza Minetti, a woman who will eventually
                    go on to become not just his greatest muse but also the
                    bearer of the most meaningful relationship in his life. His
                    equations with colleagues, his desire to outshine
                    Balenciaga, his ingenious invention of the plastic
                    water-proof suede jacket, and his mad genius which would
                    come and disappear in spurts are all outlined here. The most
                    deliciously watchable show is of course the 1973 Battle of
                    Versailles. Running a little shy of one entire hour it is an
                    entire film in itself with its soaring ego clashes,
                    last-moment mishaps, and a final roaring climactic stretch
                    that reaffirms the fundamental rags to riches template of
                    the overall narrative.

                    This is also important in the way it views past trauma as an
                    important determinant in driving present decisions. The
                    moment in which Halston decides to go commercial with his
                    art is a moment that is a culmination of past trauma and
                    insecurity that had left him feeling vulnerable in a world
                    that is primarily hostile to all living within it. And this
                    very deal, signed in a moment of absolute panic is what
                    ruins Halston eventually.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The trajectory of the series is predictable of course. We
                    know that the artiste shall see the face of success and
                    descend into a vortex of unprecedented drugs and sex and at
                    the same time as the genius gets diluted in the face of this
                    scene of excess friends turn into foes and ultimately ruin
                    is awaits till redemption is tasted sweetly on the lips in a
                    moment of small albeit pyrrhic triumph. But even when the
                    screenplay seems to drag, what keeps us invested in the
                    story is the performance of the figure at the center of this
                    mayhem.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Which brings me to my next point. Although McGregor offers a
                    career-best performance in his interpretation of the Halston
                    persona one cannot shake off the feeling that it is still a
                    heterosexual A-list star essaying the role of a gay man. The
                    story of the tortured gay man, as mentioned by Rahul Desai,
                    has been seen before in films like
                    <i>The Imitation Game</i>, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>, and
                    <i>Rocketman</i>, and although Halston as a series does not
                    shy away from explicit scenes of convincingly simulated sex
                    and exploration of queer politics, the template of the
                    tortured gay artiste, desperately needs to be revamped by an
                    authentic queer interpretation by a wholely queer actor.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The writing by Murphy ensures authenticity, but in an age
                    where representation is a pivotal concern for most this
                    issue needs to be addressed as fast as possible. We need
                    more films like Boys in the Band and Pose where queer
                    appropriation will be a thing of the past. But this in no
                    way is to undermine the brilliance of the craft that
                    McGregor brings to the fore. His performance adds more
                    nuance to the character than the screenplay, be it in the
                    scene where he asks his lawyer to pay off his blackmailing
                    lover, or where he asserts his need to be alone to another
                    lover. His lack of rootedness in light of a tormented
                    childhood and a demanding work-space are true queer
                    mainstream experiences and McGregor brings great panache and
                    empathy to these strains of his character. The full range of
                    his acting chops come forth in the scenes involving the
                    secretion of the Halston perfume and the final episode where
                    his estranged but long-term colleague, played by an
                    excellent and ever-reliable David Putta, reads out reviews
                    of his swansong. As Halston stares out of his townhouse, his
                    steely exterior shows his indifference towards the critics
                    who never understood him but his eyes and their hardly
                    concealed tears show the triumph he feels at his vision
                    being finally understood by a world that has been more than
                    just cruel to him and his art.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I wish this depth of performance had extended to the writing
                    too, digging deeper into concerns such as the process of the
                    creation of the brilliant plastic suede and the
                    hetero-romantic relationship he shared with Liza Minatelli,
                    who essayed by a Krista Rodryguez is hugely watchable
                    (especially in the recreation of the Cabaret scene). I only
                    wish the writers had made the choice to spend as much time
                    on the peripheral characters in the Halston universe in a
                    web series, that is an excellent return to form by creator
                    Ryan Murphy and a definite must-watch this coming Pride
                    Month. When the pulp of the sex and drugs and colourful
                    fabrics fade, the nuances do remain and settle like dust.
