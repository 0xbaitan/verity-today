                    When Al Pacino, in the Godfather III (a very decent movie,
                    despite the constant repugnance on the matter), said “Just
                    when I thought I was out, they pull me back in,” he didn’t
                    only realize what the major theme of the trilogy (and quite
                    majorly, his adult life) was, he subconsciously hinted at a
                    major philosophical debate which has persevered through the
                    ages.

                    For those even amateurly familiarized with philosophy, this
                    may allude to the free will debate. Are we really capable of
                    change? I mean, sure we are. It’s how the world works. Just
                    because someone chokes on McDonald’s 4 times a week doesn’t
                    mean they aren’t eventually going to shift to gluten-free
                    burgers (what a genius idea!)

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    All jokes aside, I want to clarify that this article dwells
                    on the issue of moral responsibility for change, and the
                    capability to take control of it: through the beautifully
                    written fall arc of The Godfather’s Michael Corleone. It is
                    a trivial observation of philosophical conflict in a movie,
                    the name of which is exhausted in conversations and
                    commentaries. Let us begin.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It is accurate, as the existentialist philosophers say, that
                    Existence precedes Essence: the widely revered theory that
                    your interests and actions mould who you are, making
                    identity a by-product which flows alongside your life (and
                    not a component present from before your birth) Does that
                    mean you’re in control of your essence? According to the
                    Existentialists, yes. According to ancient and modern
                    determinist theories? No.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Not surprisingly, who you are is, in fact, controlled to a
                    large extent by the way your brain works and interprets
                    things, involving the impulses it sends across to your
                    consciousness. Now, these impulses, in turn, are carefully
                    designed by the consciousness through the perception of past
                    experiences. These experiences range from hostile encounters
                    to value education, and majorly determine who you are and
                    how you view the world. However, most of these experiences
                    are… designs of external agencies, many of them being
                    physical in the sense that they can be scientifically
                    predicted. In contrast, Epicurus, an ancient Greek
                    philosopher said-
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others
                    through our own agency. Necessity destroys responsibility
                    and chance is inconstant; whereas our own actions are
                    autonomous, and it is to them that praise and blame
                    naturally attach.”
                  </p>
                
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    On one side, you have a school of thought proposing free
                    will, stimulating us to examine whether we are in control of
                    our actions, to which many of us respond “Aye.” But on the
                    other and more convincing hand, proving to us that our
                    identity is shaped by past experiences with foreign stimuli
                    or even other people, who in turn were stimulated by
                    predictable physical changes to act in the way they did.
                    Even the brain, which controls our impulses and actions, is
                    biological- making it a physical agent. This strikes an
                    existentialist dilemma- are we in control of who we are?
                    Don’t we feel free? Don’t we make our own decisions-
                    significant or insignificant, consciously or less
                    consciously- and in the process, undergo experience and
                    change?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It’s complicated. Let’s take a look at Michael Corleone’s
                    character arc.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Initially, Michael is an outlier as compared to his family,
                    all the patriarchs of which (his brothers and father) run an
                    empire of crime. He estimates authority, but also values
                    objective morality. He understands and explicitly states
                    that he is not like his family, which is quite believable
                    considering his participation as a navy-man in the Second
                    World War. Michael is free from the natures of his family,
                    and wills to be so. However, when Don Corleone, his father
                    is shot several times and hereby weakened by antagonizing
                    forces in the city, Michael formulates a responsibility that
                    he feels he is obliged to take. He starts to nudge his
                    brothers to involve him in the family business, ultimately
                    killing those who ordered the attempted ambush on his
                    father, and becoming a true Corleone. All this while he has
                    started neglecting his old habits, duty to his country, and
                    ethical, moral and romantic attachments to Kay Adams, his
                    honest and charming partner, who kept Michael on the path of
                    goodness.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    <img
                      src="/articles/June2021/Entertainment/michael-corleone/IMG2.jpg"

                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Besides, Michael is now a murderer, and scarcely regards it
                    as traumatic or a hindrance to his values. Thus begins one
                    of the most Satanic falls into depravity and turpitude in
                    narrative history- a picture of how environment degrades man
                    and man, his environment. Jump to Godfather III, and you see
                    that Michael knows of his fall from grace: he is conscious
                    and deeply regretful. He is partly in shock- he wonders when
                    he was transformed into his father, nay, a man even more
                    barbaric- devoid of honour and moral composure; a man
                    capable of killing his own blood.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    From this description and my deduction, it follows that many
                    people naturally lean towards allotting Michael (or
                    individual agents in civilization) responsibility for his
                    (their) actions. If Michael was revered for being
                    independent through choice in the beginning of the
                    franchise, it is only reasonable that he be solely burdened
                    with culpability for his fall. Even Michael, in fact, says
                    in the screenplay a line which was cut out of the final
                    product-
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    He says this in conversation with his father, Don Corleone.
                    The Don then goes onto say-
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Believe in a family. Can you believe in your country? Those
                    Pezzonovante of the State who decide what we shall do with
                    our lives? Who declare wars they wish us to fight in to
                    protect what they own. Do you put your fate in the hands of
                    men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people
                    to vote for them? Michael, in five years the Corleone family
                    can be completely legitimate. Very difficult things have to
                    happen to make that possible. I can't do them anymore, but
                    you can, if you choose to.”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The next line in the screenplay states-
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Michael listens.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    If we look (or read) carefully enough, this is the
                    conversation where Michael is almost wholly converted to
                    Evil. Mind you, he doesn’t choose to be. But he does sign
                    off on it. He similarly signed off on joining the army
                    because he respected his father but not his business (read
                    the screenplay for more insights.) He steps up to kill for
                    the similar reason: family takes precedence. His environment
                    constantly pushes him towards spiritual devolution, whether
                    it be through Don Corleone, his brothers’ hotheadedness and
                    subsequent incompetence, or the antagonists throughout the
                    three films. His first wife was bombed and killed in front
                    of him because of prejudice against himself. Environment
                    degrades man. Nonetheless, Michael changes again- and this
                    time for the better, though it is too late. He changes
                    primarily because of Kay’s participation (and lack thereof)
                    in his life, in addition to his witness of the murder and
                    decay he has caused around him.
