                    Satyajit Ray is a man who needs no introduction. He is a
                    master craftsman, who has won international accolades for
                    his films. A pinnacle of Bengali cinema, his versatility is
                    unmatched, not only with filmography but with story writing,
                    music, and other forms of artistry. He can weave a story
                    that enthralls an audience of all ages.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Ray’s depictions of female characters stray far from a
                    subservient housewife whose persona has been completely
                    crushed under the weight of societal pressure. They are
                    typically soft-spoken but witty, intelligent individuals who
                    have a strong moral compass and an abundance of honesty. His
                    characters are also intersectional- they exist from various
                    strata of society, which helps preserve the relatability of
                    his films.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When you think of some of Ray’s iconic female protagonists,
                    one film comes to mind straightaway- Charulata (1964), an
                    iconic film based on a story written by Rabindranath Tagore,
                    whose exemplary portrayal of ‘Charu’ in Nastanirh (The
                    Broken Nest) was initially received with mixed feelings from
                    Bengali aficionados. Ray later brought her alive on screen
                    with a stunning portrayal by Madhabi Mukherjee. It is the
                    story of a woman grappling with the burden of loneliness and
                    repressed passion. We see her as a poised and distinguished
                    woman with a restless longing stirring inside her and her
                    bookshelves stocked with novels. She spreads her wings from
                    being a fervent reader to an adept writer when her work is
                    published in a magazine despite the mixed feelings from her
                    brother-in-law Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee). Charu is a
                    character who undergoes an emotional, sexual, and
                    intellectual awakening within the four walls of her
                    domesticity- an inspiration for many women in the 60s.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Another depiction by Madabhi Mukherjee shows the evolution
                    of Arati, who goes from elegant housewife to working woman
                    in Mahanagar (1963). This endeavour to support her family is
                    met with the stone-cold disapproval of her father-in-law and
                    fosters a green-eyed monster of jealousy in her husband
                    Subrata (Anil Chatterjee). For Arati though, this is her
                    chance to explore new horizons and a world that is rapidly
                    developing before her very eyes. Her fresh persona is
                    depicted by a single tube of lipstick, which she wears at
                    work but wipes off before coming home. This subtle use of
                    symbolism is used by Ray in several other instances like the
                    single hairpin in his debut film Pather Panchali (1955) and
                    needless to say, it is a stroke of genius.
                  </p>

                      alt="image"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Speaking of Pather Panchali, this is another of Ray’s films
                    which is revisited again and again. A stunning debut that
                    overcame several obstacles and took over three years to
                    film, Pather Panchali also features strong women roles. The
                    first film in the Apu trilogy, Ray explores characters like
                    Apu’s resilient sister Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and his stoic,
                    yet silently emotional mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Banerjee).
                    The later films feature his colourful and candid wife Aparna
                    (played by Sharmila Tagore) who’s like a breath of fresh air
                    despite her premature demise in Aparajito (1956).

                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It would feel incomplete to talk about Ray without
                    mentioning some of his smaller women roles- those who
                    effortlessly stole the show despite being a side character.
                    Like Aparna (Sharmila Tagore) in Aranyer Din Ratri (1970)
                    who quietly let the male protagonist Ashim (Soumitra
                    Chattopadhyay) win at a memory game to avoid shattering his
                    frail male ego; it’s these characters that add a certain
                    charm to his films.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    <img
                      src="/articles/June2021/Entertainment/satyajit-rays-potrayal-of-women/IMG5.jpg"
                      alt="image"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Ray’s portrayal of women gives them an underlying, yet
                    superior sense of morality and judgement- a stark contrast
                    with the often oblivious or impulsive male heroes. That
                    being said, both his male and female counterparts usually
                    mesh with the film effortlessly, and exist parallelly to one
                    another. His characters are expressed not by diminishing or
                    undermining his male characters, but by creating a
                    harmonious coalescence between them and the film. There’s a
                    reason why his films are still celebrated today, and it is
                    because of his ability to show these relatable characters
                    through engaging tales.
