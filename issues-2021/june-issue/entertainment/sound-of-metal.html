                    You wake up one fine day, turning through another awaited
                    page of a truly fulfilling life- you’re free to look at how
                    the pale sun polishes the surface of your surroundings
                    symbolizing your blossoming joy of being thankful for life
                    and sip your hot latte with a hint of cream which serves as
                    a near-perfect supplementary device to flourish in the light
                    cold weather. All your senses awaken and jubilate as you put
                    on your clothes for work. But there’s something different-
                    what is it? You queerly cannot hear the gay chirping of the
                    woodpigeons nor the busy horns on the streets which
                    characterize the stimulating mornings in your town. You get
                    a call from your mother- but it’s strange- she’s inaudible.
                    You try to tell her to unmute her cell’s microphone- but the
                    words don’t come out. Suddenly, it all dawns on you and the
                    world flips upside down.

                    Okay- now, Sound Of Metal, what a movie. This movie, and a

                    year for the industry- might just make you believe that the
                    Academy Awards in April won’t be all that numb.

                    Riz Ahmed (you may know him from The Night Of, Nightcrawler)
                    plays Ruben Stone, a drummer by profession- who performs for
                    a very, very angry heavy-metal duo Blackgammon, with the
                    other member being his significant other - Lou, played by
                    Olivia Cooke (Ready Player One). The film starts, and you do
                    not know what to expect. While the beginning is vague, it
                    gives a thrilling radiance as dim and variant lights flash
                    in a frenzy with the cameras moving around, and fixating
                    themselves on one of Blackgammon’s tour performances with
                    Olivia Cooke singing lines ranging from “There’s something I
                    want to eat.” to “I’m sorry you’re cheap and violent.”
                    (Art.) However, there’s something very significant about
                    this opening sequence- Lou’s singing does not have perfect
                    clarity- it’s somewhat indistinct and muffled up. Subtitles
                    say the same, and it serves as a forerunner to one of the
                    very important decisions the director (Darius Marder, Sound
                    of Metal is the second film directed by him) makes in the
                    film. We’re led into Ruben Stone’s repetitive but peaceful
                    world of metal music and angry drumming, with his girlfriend
                    and him on an amateur tour whilst living in his somewhat
                    wholesome 70s trailer.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    One fine morning, Ruben wakes up in jubilation, amazed by
                    his life like our anonymous character at the beginning of
                    this article. And very much like that character, Ruben faces
                    a most daunting fate when he consults a doctor in
                    desperation and finds out that he’s almost completely lost
                    his hearing- and narcotics in addition to (probable)
                    involvement of the constant exposure to the music which he
                    plays, have been factors leading up to it. From hereon, the
                    main focus of the movie becomes character development as
                    Ruben kicks off on his journey of being deaf. As expected,
                    he doesn’t take it well. He’s aggressive, hostile and in
                    denial of the situation which has knocked on his door. I
                    wouldn’t know about how this captures the crisis one goes
                    through after one loses one of their biological senses, but
                    it’s definitely not a touchy-feely reaction without chaotic
                    outburst. And the movie realizes that. It was originally
                    supposed to be more of a documentary to be released a few
                    years earlier by another director with Darius Marder on
                    their team, but I’m pretty sure it does much better as a
                    drama feature, because the writing is absolutely immaculate
                    and the actors execute it well.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Capturing one as he goes through losing his hearing is not
                    an easy task. At all. But the directing team makes a very,
                    very strong attempt. As the film progresses, we see Lou
                    frantically try to help Ruben, and eventually going
                    reluctantly to Belgium after the host of a deaf community
                    they decide upon tells her that Ruben needs to be free from
                    distraction- in order to cope with the loss that has just
                    crossed him. Here, the theme of the conflicts between
                    consensual love and self-detachment is explored- a theme
                    forming one of the bases of many insightful spiritual texts.
                    Ruben involves himself in the deaf community and gradually
                    learns a little to live with himself.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Marder uses scenes of Ruben in the same environment in a
                    “before/after” sort of fashion to contrast our lead’s
                    progress and maximize the evidence behind it. However, Ruben
                    has still failed to reject the assumption that being deaf is
                    a handicap. After doing what he needs to to get a highly
                    costly cochlear aid against the advice of the community
                    leader, he goes to Lou’s father’s house in Belgium- and has
                    a heart-to-heart with him. All this while, his cochlear
                    implants have been giving him a most severe irritation, with
                    feedback buzzing itself in his eyes constantly.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The implants are a disappointment, and actually outweigh
                    what Ruben went through in terms of difficulty hearing. When
                    Lou comes home, Ruben and her are meeting after a long, long
                    time. But it’s not at all how you would expect two long-lost
                    lovers with their love deterred by “handicaps” to meet. It’s
                    slightly awkward, and very disappointing to the immediate
                    audience- like life. After a party at Lou’s place and
                    spending the night with her- a night where they both decided
                    that parting was the best option for them- one of the most
                    heart touching scenes of the movie takes precedence (“You
                    changed my life, Lou.”), Ruben leaves, the following
                    morning. Here comes the most important part of the movie.
                    Ruben sits on a bench in the city, as life revolves around
                    him- people having a bike ride in the morning, pedestrians
                    indulging their mildly entertaining self-absorbed routine-
                    as Ruben’s cochlear implant keeps making his ears buzz with
                    feedback. The elemental beauty of nature and life around him
                    is ruined by the implants. And Ruben simply takes his sound
                    processors off. All the chatter of the city and his
                    processor is gone. He looks around with a new perspective on
                    life and experiences the true beauty of detachment and
                    observation- no matter audible or inaudible. Life is tough,
                    and ugly. But he’s made a decision, and is determined to
                    live with it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I love this movie for everything it is- a heavily accurate
                    representation of a pertinent issue, a cinematic mosaic of
                    talented actors and sound producers, a 2-hour watch of
                    excellent cinematography, but all of these are toppled by
                    the writing and the themes that the writing explores.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The themes met in spirituality of self-detachment and
                    letting go take precedence in this motion picture, and they
                    resonate with everyone in their audience- peculiarly having
                    a universal effect through a movie specific to a community
                    of people. Ruben represents the modern man attached to life
                    and all it’s virtues, in love with what he does, and empty
                    when made devoid of it. His implants symbolize the
                    attachments to his old life he still bears after months of
                    self-discipline, and him taking them off represents
                    self-detachment and inner peace. When the camera zooms in on
                    the local church at the end, it represents Ruben having
                    resonated with himself and a superior being, if there is
                    one. This is all obviously a very spiritual overview, but
                    it’s interpretation of the aspect of the universality cannot
                    be compromised because of the very impactful detailing and
                    construction of Ruben and his challenges.

                    A true masterpiece, Sound of Metal is sure to be one of the
