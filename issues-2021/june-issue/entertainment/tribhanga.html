                    In Tribhanga, Anuradha Nayantara Apte (hold on to that big
                    name, we’ll return to it), played by Kajol, is a dancer and
                    film star who at one point likens each of the women in her
                    family to a dance pose. Her mother Nayantara (Tanvi Azmi) is
                    abhanga, slightly off-balance, off-kilter. Her daughter
                    Masha (Mithila Palkar) is samabhanga, completely balanced.
                    And she herself is tribhanga, which is the posture
                    resembling an S: the knees go one way, the torso another,
                    the head tilted: she is ‘tedhi, medhi, crazy but sexy’.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But the film’s name is not Abhanga-Samabhanga-Tribhanga; it
                    is simply Tribhanga. I thought about this for a while and it
                    struck me that Anu may liken her family to different
                    bhangas, but in reality, all three women are in the
                    tribhanga zone. Take her mother, whom she refers to as
                    ‘Nayan’ and never ‘aai’. Nayan is a fêted Hindi writer
                    (she’s a language whiz in general, having translated her own
                    novel Kaai into English), who was a fiery feminist in a time
                    being a fiery feminist meant you were a whore. Nayan was
                    married with two children (Anu and her brother
                    Ravi/Robindro), but her lifeblood was writing: she lived to
                    write and wrote to live, and this caused terrible friction
                    with her mother-in-law and eventually even with her
                    well-meaning husband. So she took the children and left,
                    carving a life for herself. She decided that since she was
                    single-handedly raising Anu and Ravi, since their father
                    didn’t feel comfortable keeping in touch, she would give the
                    children her name. Anuradha Joshi was now to be known as
                    Anuradha Nayantara Apte. And while this was an admirable
                    move, it was two generations too early: Anu ends up being
                    laughed at at school for having a different name from her
                    father, for having divorced parents. (I say two generations
                    specifically because I know people my age who carry their
                    divorced mothers’ names with pride.) Later, when Nayan
                    remarries, she is so blinded by love that she doesn’t see
                    the abuse Anu suffers at her new husband’s hands, even
                    though it happens right under her nose.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Anu grows up bitter at what she sees as her mother’s
                    negligence and self-absorption. She insists that Nayan
                    instigated chaos in her and her brother’s lives with her
                    free-spirited lifestyle. She decides she will shield her
                    daughter from what she suffered as a child. So she never
                    marries, has a string of affairs (she believes ‘monogamy is
                    injurious to health’), and never lets her boyfriend stay
                    over. She has a much healthier relationship with Masha than
                    she does with Nayan. And yet, in the film’s most affecting
                    scene, we come to see that like it or not, some of Nayan’s
                    parenting and approach to life has rubbed off on Anu.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And Masha has reacted to the influence of these two fiercely
                    independent women by running in practically the opposite
                    direction: in the desire to give her own children the
                    ‘stable’ and ‘normal’ family neither she nor her mother had,
                    she has married into the kind of large, conservative joint
                    family where the women are expected to cover their heads
                    when men and the elders are in the room. It comes through in
                    the costumes – Anu dresses trendily in flowing shrugs,
                    colourful tops and embroidered jeans, her hair in a messy
                    bun; Masha is nearly always in salwar-kameezes with a bindi
                    to match, and perfectly straightened hair.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The story of these women is told through the framing device
                    of Nayan’s autobiography, which she is writing with the help
                    of a young writer named Milan (Kunaal Roy Kapur). The
                    characters are brought together when she suddenly slips into
                    a coma and Milan rushes her to hospital. These two devices –
                    the narration of one’s life to a biographer/therapist and
                    the illness/death of someone bringing the family together –
                    are very, very been-there-done-that. Writer-director Renuka
                    Shahane does her best to tweak them to mould her story, such
                    as when Anu’s reminiscences about her childhood are
                    interspersed with recordings of Nayan talking about the same
                    time, or Anu, Nayan and Masha’s views on Masha’s marriage –
                    spoken at different times – intercut with one another. But
                    it still feels a bit awkward, especially when Milan
                    conveniently keeps turning up to wring confessions out of
                    everyone. The flashback scenes of Nayan’s struggles in her
                    first husband’s home work better, crackling with tension;
                    this may also be because they flow easily in Marathi. In the
                    present, the characters speak largely in Hindi and quite a
                    bit of English; while it is true that we often grow up and
                    grow out of our mother tongues, speaking to our parents in
                    the language we are educated in, this Marathi-Hindi
                    transition is never fully explored.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And really, it should have been explored because this is a
                    movie that is very conscious of language (it’s very writerly
                    in that sense). Milan is given to speaking in the shuddh-est
                    of shuddh Hindi; he frequently gets on Anu’s nerves for
                    this. When he asks why she uses so many apshabd, she demands
                    why he can’t just say gaali. His English, on the other hand,
                    is a bit weak: Anu upbraids him severely for saying that
                    Nayan wanted to be ‘burnt’ after she died. Meanwhile, in the
                    recordings of Nayan, we hear her speak a beautiful, assured
                    Hindi (and Tanvi Azmi makes the words roll off her tongue
                    much better than Kunaal Roy Kapur, who occasionally gives
                    the impression of a school kid who’s mugged up Hindi lines
                    for annual day): she refers to the chasm that developed in
                    her relationship with her daughter as khaai – which reminded
                    me of the name of her book, Kaai. Even the subtitles have
                    some fun: when Anu dismissively talks about dadajee-padajee,
                    the titles read ‘grandfather-grandfather’.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Shahane’s script, while structurally formulaic, develops the
                    central theme of the cycle of life through its characters.
                    The idea that, like it or not, we become our parents when we
                    become parents is a kind of universally accepted truth that
                    even Philip Larkin wrote a poem about: ‘They fuck you up,
                    your mum and dad,’ he wrote, but acknowledged, ‘But they
                    were fucked up in their turn’. Here, too, Anu has to grapple
                    with the fact that her mother doesn’t stop being her mother
                    just because she stops calling her aai. Masha has to deal
                    with what the examples of her mother and grandmother mean to
                    her. Nayan spends most of the film in a coma, but we see
                    that in her old age, she has had to come to terms with the
                    fact that her blazingly feminist attitude to life may have
                    actually had a negative impact on her children, and
                    particularly Anu.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    These are complex women and the actresses really get into
                    them. Both Azmi and Palkar make an impression, one with her
                    zest for life, the other with a kind of muted optimism. But
                    it’s Kajol who gets the most interesting character, the one
                    with two levels of conflict (as a daughter, as a parent),
                    both of which are reflected back to her. Kajol is great when
                    she doesn’t have to speak; but her line readings tend to be
                    … Kajol. She seems to like to play this kind of loud,
                    slightly brash woman, but she is unconvincing in a lot of
                    her exasperated moments. She sounds like an extension of her
                    interviews. But when she’s silent? When there’s nobody
                    around but her mother in a coma? That’s when she lets her
                    face talk, and those scenes are the ones that don’t let you
                    dismiss her performance. It is tempting to imagine, though,
                    what an actress with a felicity for dialogue might have done
                    with Anu. Someone like Vidya Balan, perhaps – who played a
                    very Nayan-esque character in Shakuntala Devi, an
                    independent, self-absorbed, free-willed mother whose
                    daughter comes to resent her.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It’s also tempting to imagine the autobiographical elements
                    that might have gone into this screenplay: Shahane, an
                    actress, is the daughter of theatre critic and bilingual
                    writer Shanta Gokhale, but she has said that she and her
                    mother have a wonderful personal relationship. Her direction
                    here is a trifle shaky. Scenes often overstay their welcome,
                    inching towards completion but dragging themselves out to
                    get there. Occasionally they begin to resemble a soap opera,
                    particularly when Shahane has to stage actual violence. A
                    scene where a pregnant Anu is slapped by her boyfriend whom
                    she then proceeds to whack with an umbrella comes off as
                    embarrassingly amateurish. And it also doesn’t help that
                    Shahane layers some pretty heavy music into charged scenes;
                    several of the confrontations might have played better if
                    left raw and unscored – instead they occasionally tip
                    towards syrupy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    For all this, though, Tribhanga is remarkably efficient,
                    barely stretching to an hour-and-a-half (I almost thought it
                    was too short), making no detours for songs or – god forbid
                    – love tracks. It’s ostensibly about mothers and daughters,
                    but it’s really about being a parent and being a child. It’s
                    also about what it really means to be ahead of one’s time:
                    it’s always said as a compliment, but in actual context it
                    can often turn out to be a very difficult thing. The film
                    never demonises any of its characters, and we are left at
                    the end without the satisfyingly pat ‘happy’ resolution.
                    Sometimes, our personalities are at odds with our lives and
                    that’s just how it is.
