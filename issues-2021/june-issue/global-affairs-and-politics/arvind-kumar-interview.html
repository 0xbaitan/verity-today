                    initiative, Cycle Soldiers and its philanthropic

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    My name is Arvind Kumar and I'm a postgraduate student
                    pursuing my Masters in Public Policy from King's College
                    London. I returned to India from the UK in February this
                    year when the second wave of COVID-19 gripped the UK.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I started Cycle Soldiers, a voluntary essential delivery
                    service for senior citizens living alone in Kolkata during
                    the first lockdown in 2020. We deliver essential medicines,
                    groceries, and food to vulnerable senior citizens and
                    COVID-19 affected families at no extra cost. To snap the
                    spread of the virus, the Government of India announced a
                    complete lockdown in 2020 which was necessary but was also a
                    cause for hardship for senior citizens who suddenly found
                    themselves isolated and without any help. The movement of
                    people and transport was restricted: senior citizens, being
                    the most vulnerable to contract the virus, were asked not to
                    step out of their homes. The lockdown also meant that their
                    house helps would be unavailable.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I could only imagine my grandmother in such a situation and
                    that thought pushed me to do something for all the Dadu's,
                    Dadi's, and Thankumas of Kolkata. In 2021 once again,
                    Kolkata is under lockdown like several other cities in India
                    to bring the second wave of infections under control and
                    Cycle Soldiers are on the ground once again to lend a
                    helping hand to the administration
                  </p>

                    How did the concept of Cycle Soldiers first materialize?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I made a poster on Photoshop and uploaded it on WhatsApp and
                    Facebook. My messages on both these social platforms
                    speedily traveled and were shared by many. The Cycle
                    soldiers reached different parts of the world to many
                    relieved sons or daughters living abroad, with their old
                    parents residing alone in Kolkata. With house helps retired
                    to their homes, these senior citizens suddenly had none to
                    help, for any emergency or needs. I decided to deliver
                    essential medicines and groceries to senior citizens living
                    alone at no extra cost and working 24x7 with my brand Cycle
                    Soldiers.

                    I walked up to my local police station, Rabindra Sarovar
                    Police Station. I met with the Officer-in-Charge, Mr.
                    Jayanta Mukherjee. I explained to him the aim and objective
                    of Cycle Soldiers. "I am proud of youths like you, who even
                    in these critical times of virus exposure are venturing out
                    to help those in need. Most in your age might enjoy this
                    time and sit at home and relax.", said the OC. He asked me
                    to meet with Mr. Bodhisattva Pramanik, another officer who
                    stamped the permit and wished me luck. Mr. Pramanik assured
                    me that the police would give all assistance when and where
                    necessary. "If they stop you anywhere, I am only a call
                    away," Mr. Pramanik said while handing over his contact card
                    to me.

                    Bangalore, and Kolkata too were seeking assistance. Many
                    senior citizens had their children working in different
                    cities and in different parts of the world, helpless and
                    unable to join with families and parents due to the

                    It was the second day of lockdown, a Thursday, and I was
                    watching the news. My grandmother called on the phone,
                    lamenting that she could not go to the temple. My mother
                    requested me to go and deliver her some halwa, flowers and
                    also some medicines for my grandmother.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    "Why did you have to take such a risk and come? What if the
                    police catch you? I'm bored sitting just for two days inside
                    the home," rued my grandmother. I realized the impact of the
                    lockdown on senior citizens like her and tried to understand
                    her needs. There were tears in her eyes when I asked her not
                    to worry about me because I would have to visit her
                    frequently to deliver her medicines and groceries during the
                    lockdown.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The episode set me thinking. My grandmother was lucky to
                    have someone to deliver essential items to her at her
                    doorstep. At the same time, there were many senior citizens
                    in Kolkata, living in isolation with nobody to help. I
                    shared this thought with my parents. They suggested I do
                    something about it. It set me thinking, and the concept of
                    'Cycle Soldiers,' was born.

                    arranging hospital beds, oxygen, medicines, food, and other
                    resources, citizens have come to each other's rescue. Social
                    media has provided an almost universal platform to seek and
                    arrange help. Numerous celebrities on social media amplified
                    small services like Cycle Soldiers and others giving us
                    greater traction and visibility, which helped our messages
                    reach more households.

                    What advice would you give to those who aspire to do
                    something similar?

                    We can all do our bit to participate as responsible citizens
                    during this hour. All it takes is the first step. I would
                    like to tell those who are aspiring to voluntarily help
                    during the pandemic to not hesitate in taking that first
                    step. You will ask several questions to yourself and will
                    also be apprehensive but if you have decided that you want
                    to enact welfare for society and drive change with your
                    contributions, that idea will take you a long way. Let us
                    use all our privileges to help those who lack them.
