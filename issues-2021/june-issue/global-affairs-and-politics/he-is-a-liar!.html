                    single poster in Bengal, Karnataka, Gujarat, Punjab or for
                    that matter, anywhere in India–is largely responsible for
                    the governments that have run those states? In fact, even
                    the current ruling national government and Prime Minister
                    Modi owe part of their 2014 landslide general election
                    victory to this man—Prashant Kishor, India’s foremost
                    political analyst and the talk of the town, following
                    Trinamool Congress (AITC/TMC) and DMK’s victories in the
                    West Bengal and Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Elections,

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Kishor, having worked as a public health activist and WHO-UN
                    aid mission trainee in West Africa, caught the attention of
                    then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in 2011, having
                    written a paper to prove health indices in India's most
                    prosperous states (i.e., Gujarat) were as poor as its most
                    backward states. The duo worked together through 2014, till
                    BJP won the general elections, coming to power with Modi as
                    head—the last time Kishor worked with the BJP or Modi.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The murmur in BJP circles was that Kishor had begun to take
                    too much credit for Modi's victory, and conceded far too
                    little to the organizational efforts of party leader Amit
                    Shah and the BJP hierarchy. Once Modi took office, it soon
                    became apparent to Kishor that he had been cut loose and
                    hung out to dry, off the record. With this, began the
                    friction between Kishor and the BJP – Shah in particular –
                    that characterized the Bengal elections. On the 21st of
                    December 2020 in the weeks leading up to polling, Prashant
                    Kishor, now working for Mamata Banerjee, the incumbent Chief
                    Minister of West Bengal, tweeted:
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">

                      any better I must quit this space!” (sic)</em

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This tweet, a bold claim, was taken to be a direct response
                    to Amit Shah’s campaign cry that BJP will win over 200 of
                    the 294 constituency seats in the Bengal legislative
                    assembly. Come 2nd of May 2021, with the counting nearing an
                    end and the election results undeniably obvious, BJP managed
                    to win only 77 constituencies — barely half of the required
                    majority (148) required to form the government — while TMC,
                    Kishor’s employers, secured 213 constituencies.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The 5-month-old tweet resurfaced, with media outlets and
                    news channels scurrying to score an interview with the man
                    of the hour, to ask him how he so firmly predicted the
                    election outcome and put his job on the line. Funnily
                    enough, on the first TV-interview Kishor gave on the 2nd of
                    May with NDTV news anchor Sreenivasan Jain, he announced his
                    retirement as an election strategist citing personal
                    reasons. He did, however, explain his thought process behind
                    the tweet: TMC’s success and BJP’s smokescreen of victory.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While he acknowledged that BJP always have been and will
                    continue to be a formidable force in Indian and West Bengal
                    politics, he ascertained that he and his team were confident
                    that TMC would be able to mobilize many more constituencies
                    than the media outlets were willing to concede to them. He
                    credited the win to Mamata Banerjee’s leadership and the
                    faith that the people of Bengal have in her, paired with the
                    lack of course correction and making of amends displayed by
                    BJP. He pointed out how the BJP expected TMC to continue in
                    the same way they had prior to the major loss of 12 seats
                    they experienced in the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections.
                    According to Kishor this mistake in assuming that TMC were
                    unable to make changes, and take into account the premises
                    under which they were fighting the election, was BJP’s
                    biggest error and what caught them off-guard — presenting a
                    false sense of a lead and inevitable victory.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When asked about the public perception of BJP’s strength
                    created by the 40-50 Modi-Shah rallies that took place and
                    ministers who left TMC to join BJP, Kishor replied by saying
                    that the popularity of a party does not directly translate
                    to votes. While he took cognizance of BJP’s strength as a
                    party, he also recognized the lack of leadership at a
                    regional level in Bengal. The news anchor also brought up
                    instances where the media reported TMC to be “crumbling”
                    under the Modi-Shah effect with party members leaving every
                    day and joining forces with BJP. In reply, citing the
                    numbers, Kishor said that the ministers leaving TMC for BJP
                    were the statistically weaker polling and lower performing
                    candidates — which just strengthened the base on which TMC
                    built its campaign, clearing out the dirt between its cogs.
                    On the other hand, BJP, focusing primarily on their image
                    and public perception, welcomed these ministers with open
                    arms and saffron marigold garlands.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Kishor also went on to give all due credit to his team of
                    over 300 volunteers in the Kolkata as well as Chennai
                    office, who were the ones responsible for doing the research
                    on the ground level – collecting data and understanding what
                    the people and voters wanted in their leaders and
                    governments. At the end of the NDTV interview of Prashant
                    Kishor, the cameraman and news anchor also show a sneak-peek
                    into Kishor’s Kolkata office, with young political analysts
                    and volunteers cheering
                    <em>“Khela Shesh!” (or Game Over!</em> in reference to TMC’s
                    campaign slogan <em>m>“Khela Hobe”</em> or
                    <em>We Will Play!</em>).
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    To conclude, while the right-wing and BJP IT cell have done
                    their best to label Kishor as a liar and “a mercenary
                    preaching the gospel of democracy”, at the end of the day,
                    it was Prashant Kishor who was able to correctly look at the
                    numbers and formulate a plan which led to TMC winning the
                    elections in an evidently fair democratic process.
