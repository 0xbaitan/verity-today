                    Over the last year, we've seen a surge in anti-Asian hate
                    crimes and xenophobia. There has been a 150% increase in
                    anti-Asian hate crimes in cities like New York and Los
                    Angeles. The U.K. police data suggests a rise of 300% in
                    hate crimes towards Chinese citizens. This can be mainly
                    attributed to the spread of the COVID-19, which originated
                    in the Wuhan district of China, and was dubbed “The Chinese
                    Virus” by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

                      class="img-fluid"

                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The term "Orientalism" refers to a general patronizing
                    Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North
                    African societies, in which the west portrays these
                    societies as backwards, undeveloped, primitive, uncivilized
                    and lesser than their own.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Orientalism does not exist in a bubble. In fact, it is a
                    tool used by the West and other colonizers to justify
                    colonizing and attacking the East. An example of this is
                    that after the infamous 9/11 attacks, the Bush
                    administration listed the liberation of Muslim women as one
                    of the reasons for its invasion of Afghanistan.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We can clearly see examples of this in the media. There is a
                    sexual pattern of Orientalism in movies: Middle Eastern
                    women are sexualized and seen through the male gaze. For
                    example, in Disney's Aladdin- Jasmine is portrayed in a far
                    more risque and sexualised manner than her white
                    counterparts - the pure and innocent Cinderella or Belle
                    from Beauty and the Beast. The Chinese are also seen as
                    'dirty' and 'savages' for eating insects, dogs and other
                    meat while it is common and even considered a luxury to eat
                    other carnivorous foods such as duck, deer, cow, pigs etc.
                    in the West.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Think about how the spread of COVID-19 has been reformatted
                    as a Chinese conspiracy by racist conspiracy factions and
                    even world leaders, for that matter. Think about how the
                    media was so eager to say that the virus was caused by the
                    eating bat soup from Wuhan’s “unhygienic” and “filthy”
                    markets even though there is no concrete evidence of this.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The only semblance of evidence for this theory was a video
                    of a woman eating bat soup which went viral when COVID-19
                    was first identified in late 2019, but according to the BBC,
                    that doesn’t qualify as a directly causal action.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Another thing to think about is how these stigmas were never
                    attached to beef and steak despite the devastation of the
                    mad cow disease. How pork products and European soldiers
                    were not stigmatized during the Spanish flu despite its
                    origins as a bird borne disease that spread to pigs.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    When we blame Asians for the spread of the COVID-19 we buy
                    into the myth of the Yellow Peril. The Yellow Peril is an
                    Orientalist ideology that represents the people of East Asia
                    as an existential threat to the west and the rest of the
                    world. The idea of the Yellow Peril has caused acts of
                    violence towards Asian Americans for decades.

                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In Seattle and Tacoma, after the completion of the railroad
                    system, the Chinese were driven out of neighbourhoods. Once
                    their highly exploited labour was no longer needed, they
                    faced mob violence, upheld by state and federal laws. This
                    fear was rooted in the belief that the Chinese would overrun
                    the local communities, take away American jobs, and leave
                    the American citizens unemployed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Another example of this: in 1982, a Chinese American man
                    named Vincent Chen was brutally murdered by two white men in
                    Detroit. During this time, the Japanese automobile industry
                    had been growing at a fast rate, forcing the American
                    companies to start downsizing. One of the two men who killed
                    Vincent Chen had been recently fired from an automobile
                    company, while the other was a head supervisor there. They
                    viewed him as a representative and an embodiment of the
                    Japanese Automobile industry even though he was just a
                    drafter. In their eyes they weren't beating an innocent
                    Chinese man, but were striking the Japanese companies that
                    were taking away their jobs. They simply profiled him as the
                    'Asian other' and attacked him.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Even today, we tend to see Asians as a homogenous group with
                    no nuance or difference. This can be seen with the
                    introduction of the 'model minority' stereotype. We refuse
                    to see them as more than tropes and stereotypes. We project
                    our racist views on them. We must continue to learn, unlearn
                    and grow as people.
