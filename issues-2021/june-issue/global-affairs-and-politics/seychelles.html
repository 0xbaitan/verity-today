                    Vaccinations have been going on around the world at very
                    high rates: in countries like the United Kingdom about 26.5%
                    of the total population is fully vaccinated and 53.1% has at
                    least one shot. In places like Spain, a test concert, which
                    was conducted on April 27, ended with no new infections
                    caused at the event itself. Indeed, different parts of the
                    world are pushing back towards the so called ‘pre-pandemic’
                    normal. However, if I were to ask you amidst the current
                    situation, which is the most vaccinated country in the
                    world?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The answer isn’t the UK or the US or even any country in
                    Europe, it’s a little island country on the Indian Ocean
                    called Seychelles that has more than 60 % of its total
                    population fully vaccinated. Unfortunately, the vaccination
                    efforts were undermined recently, when Seychelles reported a
                    spike in its corona virus cases, and burdened itself with a
                    huge per-capita caseload. Even though the country is having
                    just 100 cases every day, in a country with just 100000
                    residents- that is quite dangerous. To some extent,
                    Seychelles outbreak is worse than India’s deadly one.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Seychelles, however, isn’t the anti-vaxxer’s paradise. While
                    the condition of Seychelles has brought into question how
                    effective the manufactured vaccines tend to be, it is worth
                    noting that about 65% of the 1068 active cases in the first
                    week of May have had just one dose of vaccine or were
                    completely unvaccinated. But Seychelles’ case has brought
                    into question how much is enough for reaching herd immunity
                    in any community. Yanzhong Huang, a senior global health
                    fellow contends that while countries like Israel and Great
                    Britain have seen significant case-drops since the start of
                    their vaccination campaigns, the condition of Seychelles
                    puts into question the effectiveness of the vaccines that we
                    must take into account as we try to reach herd immunity.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    About 60% of the total vaccines registered in Seychelles
                    were produced by the Sinopharm Institute in China and
                    donated to them by the UAE whereas the others were from the
                    Serum Institute of India. The WHO has contended that the
                    Sinopharm vaccines had an overall efficacy of about 78%,
                    whereas US trials have concluded that Astrazeneca vaccines
                    have an efficacy of 79%, far lower than their mRNA
                    counterparts- Pfizer and Moderna. Given the data, few people
                    have also been asked to return for their third shots, but
                    the number is said to be quite low. In general, Rand Corp.
                    estimates that just 50% of the nation’s population has
                    actually reached immunity levels required for protection and
                    that there’s still a long way to go. The Health Department
                    also stated that of all the hospital-admits, merely 20% are
                    fully vaccinated and none of them have developed any serious
                    symptoms.

                    The minister of foreign affairs, Radegonde said Thursday

                    "The conclusion is that the vaccines are protecting the
                    people. Those who have been vaccinated are not developing
                    any complications," Radegonde said. "We remain confident
                    that the vaccines -- both of them -- have helped the
                    country. Things would have been worse."
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It is also worth remembering that the vaccines created in an
                    effort to immunize people against COVID-19 have not been
                    created with the incentive of preventing COVID infections
                    per se, the main motive has been to prevent the cases from
                    getting serious. The fact that a vaccinated patient may get
                    COVID has a very low probability of happening but, as we’ve
                    seen in the news around us, it has happened. However, death
                    post-inoculation is a statistical impossibility. Vox
                    recently published a video titled, ‘Why you can’t compare
                    COVID-19 vaccines?’, explaining the entire science behind
                    the magical numbers of efficacy that have been assigned to
                    the vaccines, explaining why there isn’t enough data to
                    effectively compare the vaccines in general- “The efficacy
                    numbers really just tell you what happened in each vaccine’s
                    trial, not exactly what will happen in the real world.”
                    However, the video concluded that every vaccine in
                    circulation around the world right now was in fact capable
                    of reducing COVID to a basic fever. This was underscored by
                    Jeremy Lim, an associate professor of health at NUS’ Saw
                    Swee Hock School of Public Health who stated that the
                    vaccines may not give sterilizing immunity against the
                    virus.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Reaching herd immunity also depends on various other factors
                    such as the genetics of the population and what kind of
                    vaccine they received. In countries where Pfizer/Moderna
                    vaccines have been circulating, a move back to normalcy will
                    be easier given that both of those vaccines have an efficacy
                    greater than 90%. But Michael Lin contended that getting
                    “any vaccine” was more desirable than being exposed to the
                    1% death rate due to infection.

                    Seychelles’ tale can be a cautionary one for the whole world
                    because COVID isn’t probably going anywhere. While countries
                    will try to eradicate it, it is going to be a difficult job
                    given the tracing factors. Many scientists have indicated
                    that we will have to live with COVID and the condition in
                    Seychelles may or may not be replicated in other parts of
                    the world- it is imperative to note that every country,
                    irrespective of what stage of the pandemic they’re in, need
                    to keep track of the variants in COVID mutation from time to
                    time- and keep the public up to date as well. Scientists
                    have also indicated that as many people as possible should
                    try to get vaccinated, and that seems a challenge given,
                    vaccine hesitancy.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As we look at the current situation, it is no doubt,
                    pressing- while the US is gradually suspending mask
                    mandates, and the UK is phasing towards a complete
                    reopening, India has been struggling. It is important that
                    we never forget that this is a war we all must fight
                    together: a single country’s victory will only be
                    short-lived if the others are in turmoil, as this is but a
                    virus with scarce understanding of borders. Seychelles
                    offers us a tale of what a vaccinated could possibly look
                    like, but at present, finding enough data to support a
                    macrocosmic conclusion is beyond our means. All we can do is
                    wait and watch.
