                    Now that 2021 has begun, less than a decade is left to
                    attain the Sustainable Development Goals. The time to think
                    was yesterday, today is the time to act! With the upcoming
                    10 years having been declared as the ‘Decade of Action’, we
                    are running short of time. A great commitment and actions on
                    the ground are in grave need.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Before talking about Sustainable Development in contemporary
                    world, let’s take a brief glance at its history. Known
                    records of the concept of sustainability date back to the
                    era of ancient Chinese, Greek, and Roman writers with it
                    being an element of their “philosophy of living in harmony
                    with nature and neighbours”. Ancient civilizations in Rome,
                    Egypt, Greece and Mesopotamia faced loss of human life as a
                    result of environmental degradation from loss of soil
                    fertility, mining, river reversals, and deforestation. The
                    concept of sustainability gained momentum between 16th-19th
                    century AD when engineers and politicians realized the
                    issues of human intervention in nature, overexploitation of
                    resources, and overpopulation. In the 17th century, Dutch
                    philosopher Spinoza articulated his ideas of “preserving
                    ourselves in harmony with nature, while tying this capacity
                    to reaching a state of happiness” in the form of ‘Suum esse
                    conservare’. The book Sylvicultura Oeconomica by German
                    mining administrator Von Carlowitz from AD 1713 has mention
                    of the term “sustainability” for forestry practices. English
                    economist Thomas Malthus showed relation between population
                    and future of society in his essay introducing the
                    Malthusian Growth Model in AD 1798, while British
                    naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallance, an exemplary visionary,
                    took this even further and published ‘The Wonderful Century’
                    in AD 1898, which talks about the greatest successes &
                    failures of the 19th century, including surveys of new
                    technologies like telegraph & railway and disasters such as
                    wars, poverty, overexploitation of the environment, etc. The
                    book excellently articulates “how fundamental is the change
                    they have effected in our life and civilization” and “injury
                    done to posterity”.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The concept of ‘ecodevelopment’ came into the limelight in
                    the 1970s. ‘The Limit of Growth’ came out in 1972 and was
                    commissioned by the Club of Rome for the Project on the
                    Predicament of Mankind. It paid emphasis to how the long
                    running ‘business as usual’ model was unsustainable and
                    alteration in growth trends was needed in order to achieve
                    economic & ecological sustainability. The conclusion was
                    that the followed trajectory of human activity would soon
                    render Earth’s ecological system incapacitated. The concept
                    of sustainable development transpired during the 1972 UN
                    Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm, after
                    policymakers urged governments to address poverty, public
                    health, and environmental degradation simultaneously in a
                    more integrated manner, side-lining the long followed
                    "economic growth first and clean up later" principle. The
                    conference focused significantly on human interactions with
                    the environment. As a result, the United Nations Environment
                    Program came into existence. The World Commission on
                    Environment and Development was established in 1983 by the
                    United Nations and was charged with the responsibility to
                    prepare a report consisting of strategies to progress on
                    sustainable development. The report materialized in 1987 as
                    ‘Our Common Future’. It defined sustainable development as
                    “development that meets the needs of the present without
                    compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy
                    their own needs."

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Sustainable Development Goals we read about today are a
                    result of a long journey of evolution of concepts. The
                    Conference on Environment and Development, popularly known
                    as the Earth Summit, was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,
                    this conference resulted in formulation of what we now know
                    as the Agenda 21, a reference which tangibly defined
                    sustainability in order to determine government & corporate
                    policies to make decisions while keeping sustainability in
                    mind. The member states of the United Nations met at Rio de
                    Janeiro again in 2012, 20 years after the Earth Summit of
                    1992, for United Nations Conference on Sustainable
                    Development, also known as Rio+20. The motive for the same
                    was to begin the process of formulation of the Sustainable
                    Development Goals, which built upon the 8 Millennium
                    Development Goals which were to be achieved by 2015. This
                    historic moment was the point of convergence of the
                    environmental strand (Stockholm Declaration 1972-Kyoto
                    Protocol 2005) and the social development strand (UN
                    Development Decade 1960s-Millenium Development Goals 2000).
                    After about 3 years, on 25th September 2015, the 193 member
                    states of the United Nations unanimously adopted the
                    Sustainable Development Goals mentioned in paragraph 59 of
                    UN General Assembly Resolution 70/1, or Transforming our
                    world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which
                    reaffirms all major UN Conferences & Summits. The Agenda
                    identifies 5 areas of critical importance, widely known at
                    the 5 Pillars of Sustainable Development. They are: people,
                    planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership. Achieving the
                    agenda requires contemporaneous progress in all these areas.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    From what I’ve learnt during my course at the United Nations
                    System Staff College Knowledge Centre for Sustainable
                    Development in Bonn, Germany, I can say that Sustainable
                    Development is like a Rubik’s cube which can neither be
                    solved by focusing on one side alone, as action on one side
                    affects others, nor by solving sides one by one – we have to
                    work on all sides simultaneously. Sometimes, we even have to
                    undo what’s already done to reach a solution. Innovation,
                    trust, co-creation & collaboration are important, and things
                    may feel worse before improving, requiring the
                    deconstruction of previous thinking patterns and figuring
                    out the right intervention sequences. Prioritizing one side
                    over another will result in noncoherent outcomes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Achieving sustainable development in a balanced & integrated
                    manner requires new approaches to planning, implementation,
                    follow-up & review, anticipating & assessing specific
                    results against their effects on all five Pillars to foster
                    synergies and avoiding trade-offs & one-sided approaches.
                    There is an incredible amount of knowledge available, but we
                    don’t seem to bring it together. We need to switch from a
                    perspective seeking gradual improvement of a given situation
                    to a perspective allowing disruptive-thinking and enhancing
                    system awareness. The 2030 Agenda is extremely ambitious and
                    encourages innovative & creative ways to tackle the
                    sustainability problems. Breaking the silos and bringing
                    everyone together is the need of the hour. The private
                    sector and youth from all over the world are the key to
                    tremendous progress on the agenda, but they are often
                    overlooked. The amount of potential these sections of the
                    society hold is enormous and including them with the
                    policymakers will greatly enhance inter-sectoral coherence
                    and result in a more efficient policy cycle leading to more
                    sustainable decisions. Countries like Israel lead by example
                    when it comes to nourishing innovation in an extreme
                    environment with scarce resources. Investing in people and
                    uplifting their talent can yield the best return on
                    investment and even complement governments around the world
                    in achieving their goals. Armed with the foresight for
                    transformation, an innovative mindset, backed by the
                    stakeholders, global youth have the ultimate capacity to
                    progress immensely on this ambitious agenda.
