                    Filters are possibly the most literal manifestation of
                    humanity’s need to compartmentalize and manipulate. And it
                    impacts everyone. It is not an issue exclusive to a certain
                    group of people or community; it is a worldwide phenomenon
                    that is becoming more of a malady every second. A filter, by
                    definition, is a porous device for removing impurities or
                    solid particles from a liquid or gas passed through it.
                    This, while being the mechanical use of a filter applies the
                    same logic as software. A filter on pictures is software
                    that changes the outlook of the image by airbrushing the
                    subject, most often human, to a level of two-dimensional
                    perfection that cannot be achieved in reality. A filter in
                    fashion and clothing refers to the allotment of labels of
                    gender and size. A common thread between these different
                    aspects of filtration is the fact that they all filter the
                    physical appearance. They are meant to only alter the
                    superficial outlook of our faces and yet they impact us to
                    our very cores.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The human eye is attracted to brighter and more vivid images
                    due to the presence of photoreceptors in it that capture
                    light. Refined objects are more impressionable on the mind’s
                    eye and once we see a beautified version of an object that
                    has been morphed and airbrushed, it places the image as a
                    representation of the object in our minds. Therefore, when
                    we see the real appearance in their true, unadorned self,
                    they appear bleak and almost too three dimensional in our
                    mind. We like to believe that things exist in their
                    beautified forms and when the reality disappoints us, we
                    almost refuse to believe that that is reality. This is what
                    causes us to overuse filters and editing facilities to enjoy
                    the momentary presence of that standard of beauty.
                    Therefore, the major reason for this affinity to digital
                    beautification has its roots in our insecurities and
                    simultaneously feeds the same.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychological disorder in
                    which a person becomes obsessed with perceived flaws in
                    one’s appearance. It may be so minor as to be one barely
                    noticeable by others. However, the impact of this on one’s
                    mind leads to them constantly checking their appearance in
                    the mirror and feeling ashamed of one’s own self. This often
                    causes them to avoid social interactions and gatherings due
                    to feeling anxious and embarrassed of themselves. It could
                    branch into or comprise of countless other disorders
                    including eating disorders, depression, social anxiety, and
                    OCD. It is dangerously common with about a million cases per
                    year in India. It affects 1.7% to 2.9% of the general
                    population, making it more common than schizophrenia and
                    anorexia1 (1% and 0.21% respectively). It is most common
                    between 14 and 60 years of age. While the cause of BDD
                    ranges from peer influence and ideals derived from other
                    people on social media, a prominent cause is that filters
                    erase some parts of our faces to make the picture look
                    ‘perfect’. And when we see those parts in the mirror, we
                    deem them as flaws for being left out of the filtered
                    picture. As humans, we inadvertently try to perfect
                    ourselves and these flaws or imperfections and before we
                    realise it, that need becomes an obsession. We scrutinize
                    and tear apart that one feature till it becomes a devil
                    staring us in the face every time we look in the mirror.
                    What we don’t realise is that it’s not the wrinkle or the
                    scar that’s the evil but the blur in place of it.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    These filters have evolved from extra features to standards
                    defining of human beauty over the past decade with social
                    media growing into the most fluid form of communication
                    throughout the world. The filters have become aspirations of
                    appearances and people are molding themselves to fit into
                    these frames. A common wildfire trend is what we refer to as
                    ‘Instagram Face’. It includes a young face, pore less skin,
                    plump and high cheekbones, catlike eyes, long eyelashes, a
                    small neat nose and full lush lips2. What we fail to
                    understand though is that while some might have a natural
                    face that fits into these filters, it is one face. And that
                    is a kind of aspiration we subject ourselves to without
                    realizing that it chips a part of our self away,
                    superficially and beneath.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We have amplified the need for compartmentalization to the
                    point where it is blatantly present every time we shop for
                    something as simple as clothes. The millions of shopping
                    portals that we use all have filters for sizes, cuts,
                    lengths, colours, fabrics… and gender. The gender filter
                    consists of two subgroups: male and female. This doesn’t
                    only reduce genders to the status of size and cut of fabric,
                    it also looks at genders as two opposing ideals, completely
                    excluding the wide gender spectrum by focusing on the gender
                    binary. As normal as allocation of colours and patterns may
                    seem today, it has an impact on people. I, personally, have
                    a tendency to wear darker coloured clothes and yet every
                    time I walk into a store, I am led to the pastel blouses
                    under the huge pink board that reads “WOMEN”. And it’s not
                    being called a woman that bothers me; it’s that I knew at
                    the back of my mind, that if I wandered in the section
                    labelled MEN, people would automatically assume that I was
                    shopping for a male relative or a friend. This would and has
                    applied on every other gender. Assigning clothes to
                    personalities rob them of their identity, making them feel
                    like it’s wrong to want to look the way they want to.
                    Clothes originally served the function of protection, which
                    evolved to fashion and in this evolution, an inadvertent
                    filter was formed. We need to pull down those boards, remove
                    those filters and find better ways to arrange these objects
                    because in the end, they’re objects, accessories to help us
                    look the way we want. But they have been given the power
                    that can make people feel wrong about themselves. And that
                    kind of authority is one that no person should have, let
                    alone a few metres of fabric.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I stand by my point that one of the roots of all prejudice
                    is compartmentalisation. And prejudice is often looked at
                    from the angle that we know it is wrong, which is important.
                    One needs to identify the problem before they try to fix it.
                    But we tend to forget that that wrongdoing has an impact on
                    people, whose mental health is affected every time they are
                    put through filters, chipping away at pieces of them until
                    the final result is this stripped down personality that can
                    easily fit into a box. And that needs to stop if we want to
                    achieve this generation’s goal for a new world; one that’s
                    accepting, kinder and doesn’t tell you that if all your
                    qualities don’t fit in a box, you don’t belong. To make the
                    kind of progress we dream of, the world has to stop giving
                    software, billboards and catalogues the power to make us
                    feel like anything less than the full, true people we are.
