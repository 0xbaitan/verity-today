                    Filters are possibly the most literal manifestation of
                    humanity’s need to compartmentalise and manipulate. It
                    impacts everyone. It is not an issue exclusive to a group of
                    people or community; it is a worldwide phenomenon that is
                    becoming more of a malady. A filter, by definition, is a
                    porous device for removing impurities or solid particles
                    from a liquid or gas passed through it. The logic used in
                    ordinary mechanical filters also extends to the filters used
                    in beautification apps.

                    Filters in software serve the purpose of changing the
                    outlook of an image by airbrushing the subject, most often
                    human, to a level of two-dimensional perfection that is
                    impossible to achieve realistically. A filter in fashion and
                    clothing refers to the allotment of labels according to
                    gender and size. The common thread between these different
                    aspects of filtration is that they all filter the physical
                    appearance, altering only the superficial outlook of our
                    faces. Even so, they impact us to our very cores.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The human eye is attracted to brighter and more vivid images
                    due to photoreceptors in the eye that capture light. Refined
                    objects are more impressionable to the mind’s eye. Once we
                    see a beautified version of an object that has been morphed
                    and airbrushed, we take it as the desired representation of
                    the object. Therefore, when we see something in their
                    unadorned self, they appear bleak and almost too bland in
                    our mind. We like to believe that things exist in their
                    beautified forms. When mundane reality disappoints us, we
                    refuse to accept our imperfections. It leads to the overuse
                    of filters and editing facilities. People tend to enjoy the
                    momentary presence of that unrealistic standard of beauty.
                    Therefore, a significant reason for this affinity to digital
                    beautification has its roots in our insecurities and
                    simultaneously feeds the same.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychological disorder
                    in which a person becomes obsessed with perceived flaws one
                    has in their appearance. It may be so minor that it is
                    barely noticeable by others. However, the impact it has on
                    one’s mind causes them to constantly check their appearance
                    in the mirror and feel ashamed of themselves. It often
                    causes them to avoid social interactions and gatherings due
                    to anxiety and embarrassment. It could branch into countless
                    other disorders, such as depression, social anxiety, and
                    OCD. It is dangerously prevalent as there are about a
                    million cases per year in India alone. It affects 1.7% to
                    2.9% of the general population, making it more common than
                    schizophrenia and anorexia (1% and 0.21%, respectively). BDD
                    is most common between 14 and 60 years of age. While the
                    cause of BDD cannot be determined with certainty due to
                    varying levels of peer influence and one's preconceived
                    notions, it can be agreed upon that filters erase parts of
                    our faces to make us look ‘perfect’. And when we see those
                    parts in the mirror, we deem them as flaws for being left
                    out of the filtered photograph. As humans, we inadvertently
                    try to perfect ourselves and hide these flaws or
                    imperfections. Before we can even realise it, it has already
                    become an obsession. We scrutinise and tear apart that one
                    feature till it becomes a devil staring back at us every
                    time we face the mirror. We do not realise is that it is not
                    the wrinkle or the scar that is evil but the blur which
                    hides it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    These filters are now dominating the social media scene, as
                    observed in the past decade. The filters have become a
                    hallmark of beauty among many people. It has resulted in
                    people moulding themselves to fit into those frames. A
                    common wildfire trend has recently surfaced. It is referred
                    to as the ‘Instagram Face’. This includes a young face,
                    poreless skin, plump and high cheekbones, catlike eyes, long
                    eyelashes, a small neat nose and full lush lips. What we
                    fail to understand though is that while some might have a
                    natural face that fits into these filters, it is nothing
                    more than a face. And that is the kind of aspiration we
                    subject ourselves to without realising that it chips a part
                    of ourselves away.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We have amplified the need for compartmentalisation to the
                    point where it is blatantly present every time we shop for
                    something as simple as clothes. The millions of existing
                    shopping portals all deploy filters for sizes, cuts,
                    lengths, colours, fabric, and gender. The gender filter
                    consists of two subgroups: male and female. It does not only
                    limit gender to the size and cut of fabric; it also views
                    gender as strictly binary, completely ignoring the spectrum
                    beyond it. However, it does not end there. As seemingly
                    harmless as the allocation of colours and patterns may seem
                    today, it undoubtedly impacts people. I tend to wear darker
                    coloured clothes. Yet, every time I walk into a store, I am
                    led to the pastel blouses under a pink board that reads
                    “Women”. It is not even the fact that being called a woman
                    bothers me. It is the thought that I knew at the back of my
                    mind that if I had ever wandered into the section that
                    catered to men, people would start assuming that I was
                    shopping for a male relative or a friend. And this holds for
                    other genders as well. The labelling of clothes rob people
                    of their identity. It makes them feel like it is wrong to
                    want to look the way they want to. Clothes originally served
                    the function of protection which has evolved into fashion.
                    Thereon, through evolution, it has given rise to inadvertent
                    filters. We need to pull down those boards, remove those
                    filters and find better ways to arrange these objects
                    because, in the end, they are objects and accessories to
                    help us look the way we want. But they have been given the
                    power that can make people feel wrong about themselves. That
                    is the kind of authority no person should have, let alone a
                    few metres of fabric.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    I stand by my point that one of the root causes of prejudice
                    is compartmentalisation. Prejudice: it has always been
                    frowned upon, and that is important. One needs to identify
                    the problem before they try to fix it. But we tend to forget
                    the impact which filters have on mental health. It chips
                    away pieces of people until the final result is this
                    watered-down personality that can easily fit into a box.
                    That needs to stop if we want to achieve this vision of a
                    world without filters and labels. To achieve a vision that
                    is accepting, kinder and one that does not force you into
                    boxes or make you feel unwanted, we need to stop giving
                    technology, billboards and catalogues the power to make us
                    feel anything less than the people we truly are.
