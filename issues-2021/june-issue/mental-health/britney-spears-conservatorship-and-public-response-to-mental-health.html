                    Pop culture fiends and gossip pages have been rife with news
                    over the past two years surrounding Britney Spears and her
                    controversial conservatorship, which even sparked several
                    documentaries and an online movement entitled #FreeBritney.
                    Although the situation has been exploited by tabloids and
                    the paparazzi for clickbait and easy money, it presents an
                    insight into the longstanding issues of mental health within
                    the larger world, both in jurisdiction and legality, as well
                    as in public opinion.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Before discussing Spears herself, it is necessary to
                    understand what a conservatorship is. According to the
                    Judicial Branch of California, a conservatorship is “a court
                    case where a judge appoints a responsible person or
                    organization (called the ‘conservator’) to care for another
                    adult (called the ‘conservatee’) who cannot care for himself
                    or herself or manage his or her own finances.” Usually, such
                    cases are used in the interest of people suffering from
                    mental illnesses, or who need support in their old age. Such
                    a guardianship was also the subject of the Golden Globe
                    winning ‘I Care A Lot’ (2020), starring Rosamund Pike.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    After her initial success, Britney came under great public
                    attack in the 2000s, a phenomenon that seems to be an unfair
                    rite of passage for most female pop stars after they break
                    into mainstream attention. With constant slutshaming and
                    criticism surrounding bad press from her breakup with Justin
                    Timberlake and hypersexualised image in most music videos,
                    things came to a head in 2007, during her divorce with
                    husband Kevin Federline, when she lost custody to both her
                    children. Relentless surveillance by the paparazzi only
                    catalysed an already difficult period of her life, leading
                    to several nervous breakdowns, including the infamous
                    incident when Spears shaved her head bald. In light of these
                    mental health concerns and numerous visits to rehabilitation
                    facilities, Jamie Spears, her father, was granted
                    conservatory rights over her financial assets (as a
                    financial conservator) and over herself as a person (as a
                    personal conservator).
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Initially, this seemed to be a wise and respectable move, as
                    Spears was in a genuine need of help. However, the past few
                    years have aroused suspicions as to the effectiveness of a
                    continued guardianship. In 2019, Jamie Spears stepped down
                    from his role as personal conservator due to “health
                    issues”, and Jodi Montgomery was appointed as a temporary
                    replacement. Since then, Britney’s lawyers have issued
                    numerous statements, declaring that she was “afraid of her
                    father”, and that she would like Montgomery to be appointed
                    to this role permanently, and for her father to step down.
                    Unfortunately, this request was turned down by a Los Angeles
                    judge in early 2021, naming the financial firm the Bessemer
                    Trust a co-conservator of her estate instead. Jamie Spears’
                    conservator powers have also been extended to September
                    2021. As of now, news has broken that Britney herself has
                    requested to address the court regarding her
                    conservatorship.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While the Spears case is only one of millions around the
                    world, it has done well to shed light on a phenomenon which
                    was rarely heard about by the general public. Both parties
                    have vigorously contested the other’s claims: Jamie
                    maintains that Britney’s unhappiness in the conservatorship
                    are mere “conspiracy theories”, while her lawyers insist
                    that she is unable to speak out herself on account of her
                    father’s suppression. Neither side has been verified yet,
                    but the fact that such an atrocity is even plausible speaks
                    volumes about the mental health infrastructure that is
                    prevalent within the legislations of many nations. Such laws
                    prioritise the guardians over the actual ailing subject, who
                    is unable to voice their own grievances without fear. The
                    framework institutionalised is clearly inadequate, if there
                    is also no adequate system in place to review a judgement
                    that was passed regarding a person’s health more than a
                    decade ago.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The media response to the situation has also been telling,
                    with the paparazzi frenzy echoing that of the 2000s which
                    led to Britney’s initial breakdown. Spears herself has
                    spoken about the numerous documentaries being made about her
                    life, in an Instagram post: "So many documentaries about me
                    this year with other people's takes on my life. These
                    documentaries are so hypocritical… they criticize the media
                    and then do the same thing? Damn…”. It is evident that
                    mental health always has and continues to be trivialised by
                    mainstream media. Urgent reform is required, both in the
                    institutions that have been established to deal with mental
                    illness on a legal basis, as well as the public approach to
                    such sensitive issues that are instead sensationalised in a
                    media circus.
