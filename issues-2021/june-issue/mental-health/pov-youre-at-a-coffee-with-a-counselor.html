                    The second wave of the infamous COVID-19 brought with it an
                    equally damaging second wave of deteriorating mental health.
                    It is not surprising therefore that the prolonged
                    psychological distress caused by the virus led to the
                    widespread pervasiveness of depressive symptoms, anxiety,
                    bereavement and anger.

                    The authors of this article had the chance to interact with
                    a young counsellor, Ms. Deepashree Sonik,who has an Advance
                    Diploma in Counselling Psychology from Jamia Millia Islamia
                    and Masters in Psychology from Kurukshetra University,
                    Kurukshetra. She has also completed her Bachelors from
                    Miranda House, Delhi University.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Miss Sonik is one of the many mental health workers who have
                    started giving out free sessions during these times of
                    anguish, distress and adversity. Since she has been
                    interacting with a lot of people who experienced loss and
                    hardships, interviewing her was ideal as it gave us a
                    professional insight into this wave of mental health.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While the initial intent of the authors was to focus mostly
                    on aspects related to COVID-19, the conversation with Miss
                    Sonik progressed towards covering numerous other dimensions
                    related to Mental Health. The same has been covered under
                    various sections below.

                    It is not an unknown fact that there has always been a lot
                    of stigma surrounding mental health initiatives, services,
                    and even the very discussion of topics pertaining to it. The
                    authors were intrigued to know whether there were any
                    positive changes in the attitudes of the people in the COVID
                    era owing to the death of close family and friends. Miss
                    Sonik reaffirms that the stigma surrounding therapy or
                    counselling is still very much in existence. She also points
                    out how despite having some knowledge, various
                    misconceptions about therapy lead to people not taking up
                    the very essential first step - approaching and asking.

                    The Mental Health Infrastructure
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    India does not have the ideal mental health infrastructure
                    and has been criticised because of its inherent economic and
                    sociological drawbacks throughout the years. Additionally,
                    reports like “Reconciliations of Caste and Medical Power in
                    Rural Public Health Services” by Sobin George have further
                    contributed to its disrepute. However, Miss Sonik is hopeful
                    about the future. With growing acceptability and reduced
                    stigma among the citizens, public authorities are forging
                    ahead with the requisite modules and programmes to eliminate
                    the pre-existing hurdles in the system. On that optimistic
                    note, she agrees that this is going to be a difficult
                    battle, although, as T. Harv Eker said, "one step in the
                    right direction is better than a hundred years of thinking
                    about it".
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    “Grief looks different on everyone”
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Life and Death have been consistent visitors in every
                    household, however, death always felt like an unwanted
                    guest. The pandemic brought over two hundred thousand
                    unwanted guests to our doorsteps, without giving us a moment
                    to garner the strength we needed to welcome it. Our ways of
                    acknowledging and expressing grief are different, hence
                    there can never be a "single uniform approach" when it comes
                    to grief. The journey of grief is one of the most difficult
                    and emotionally draining journeys one has taken and requires
                    a tremendous amount of patience, self-awareness and
                    determination. As Miss Sonik rightly said, a therapist
                    cannot prescribe a set of activities that can automatically
                    ease the pain, but a therapist can help you articulate
                    emotions, which makes acknowledging your journey with grief
                    easier.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Who therapizes therapists?
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While providing therapy to someone, a therapist provides
                    different tools to the person. For example, when someone has
                    anxiety, they are given different grounding exercises which
                    help them to dial down the emotions, bringing their focus to
                    what is happening to them physically instead of clenching to
                    their feelings. Similarly, when Miss Sonik and others like
                    her go through similar feelings, they apply the same
                    techniques. Therapists have to deal with a lot of trauma, a
                    lot of pain. This often takes a toll on their own mental
                    health. “We have to deal with it to help others,” Miss Sonik
                    says. Miss Sonik emphasizes that a therapist should never
                    let any negative emotions from their patients take a toll on
                    their own mental wellbeing. “Personal Vs. Professional Life-
                    That is where the distinction is drawn” That being said, she
                    acknowledges that it is really difficult, even for highly
                    experienced therapists.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We are grateful to Ms Sonik for engaging in such an
                    important and insightful conversation with us. Our interview
                    boils down to two important points, sensitize and
                    acknowledge. The pandemic did not come with a manual for us
                    to follow on how to deal with it, and in fact, we have been
                    hard on ourselves in most cases, making it all the more
                    difficult to articulate and acknowledge our emotions.
                    Investing and prioritising our mental health is crucial,
                    particularly in these times. Seeking help has never been
                    more important.
