                    With the rise of LGBTQ+ activism and more and more people
                    having the courage to come out, the queer community is no
                    longer relegated only to the socio-political aspect of life,
                    but has also become a subject of great scientific interest.
                    The exact cause of same-sex attraction is one that has
                    baffled researchers for decades now, especially due to the
                    weaponisation of pseudo-scientific claims by medical and
                    religious institutions used to frame homosexuality as a
                    choice or an illness. Although the modern world has come a
                    long way, traces of such misconceptions still exist in many
                    cultures, which can be traced back to the late twelfth
                    century, and rooted in religious, legal, and medical
                    underpinnings.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Before the High Middle Ages, same-sex relationships were
                    largely ignored and allowed to continue by the Church in
                    Europe. However, writings by Thomas Aquinas and other
                    religious and secular leaders in the latter half of the
                    twelfth century led to hostility towards homosexuality,
                    which was soon institutionalised within the society. This
                    religious contempt eventually gave birth to legal sanctions,
                    especially in Europe and the Americas, where any form of
                    deviant sexual behaviour (such as sodomy or pre-marital
                    intercourse) was liable to be punished with stiff criminal
                    penalties. By the end of the nineteenth century, medicine
                    had joined the fray with religion and law in trying to
                    establish its jurisdiction over sexuality. Homosexuality was
                    hence considered a pathological phenomenon, or a mental
                    disease. Although incorrect, this was taken to be a
                    progressive move at the time, as ailing individuals would be
                    less ostracised and punished than sinners and criminals.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Even within psychiatry, however, homosexuality was not
                    universally viewed as a pathology. The most famous opposing
                    theories were those put forward by Sigmund Freud and Sandor
                    Ferenczi. Freud believed all human beings were innately
                    bisexual, and that they become heterosexual or homosexual as
                    a result of their experiences with parents and others
                    (Freud, 1905). Nevertheless, Freud agreed that a homosexual
                    orientation should not be viewed as a form of pathology. On
                    the other hand, Ferenczi opined that a gay man was one who
                    was confused about his sexual identity and felt himself to
                    be "a woman with the wish to be loved by a man". He believed
                    that it to be a mental illness, the cure of which might be
                    possible in the future with an advancement in psychoanalytic
                    techniques.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The inter-sectional class angle of such action taken against
                    homosexuality should also be noted. For example, in
                    twentieth century England, it was the working-class men that
                    were most likely to end up in prison if caught engaging in
                    same-sex relations. Meanwhile, the more privileged
                    middle-class men were offered conversion therapy as a
                    “softer” option to jail-time. It was within this context of
                    class, privilege and sexuality, coupled with religious
                    undertones, that conversion therapy was conceptualised, one
                    of the most famous instances of homophobic suppression.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Conversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of
                    trying to change an individual's sexual orientation from
                    homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual using psychological,
                    physical, or spiritual interventions. There is no reliable
                    evidence that sexual orientation can be changed, and medical
                    institutions warn that conversion therapy practices are
                    ineffective and potentially harmful. Methods resorted to
                    include behavioural modifications through electric shocks
                    and nausea-inducing drugs, as well as ex-gay ministry and
                    lobotomisation. Fortunately, with the declassification of
                    homosexuality as a mental illness by the American
                    Psychiatric Association in 1973, instances of conversion
                    therapy have reduced, with several nations taking
                    legislative action against it. However, it continues to be
                    legal in certain countries, including India. The law which
                    criminalised homosexuality in India was a colonial
                    imposition, brought by the British empire. Homophobic
                    narratives and those which try to medicalise same-sex
                    attraction can also be traced back to colonial ideology. Yet
                    some powerful post-colonial institutions and individuals
                    adopted these narratives and incorporated them into an
                    anti-LGBTQ+ agenda, which continues among some practitioners
                    today.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Scientific causes of homosexuality are still to be
                    confirmed, yet scientists are certain that it is most
                    definitely not a mental illness or a pathological disease,
                    nor is it a choice made by an individual. Such narratives
                    are furthered by institutions in an attempt to stigmatise
                    the queer community, and this taboo has hampered the study
                    of sexual orientations, as research into the topic has only
                    begun recently, due to the taboo surrounding it.
                    Nevertheless, new findings are being made every so often to
                    suggest that sexuality is a complex behaviour, not
                    determined by a single factor, but precluded by a variety.
