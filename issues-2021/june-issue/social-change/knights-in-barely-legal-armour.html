                    India experienced a second wave of the pandemic starting
                    from April, where COVID cases started to rise to almost 4
                    million per day. Everyone was caught off-guard when the
                    papers started reporting these incredible statistics and
                    reporting on horrific accounts of death all around. Yet
                    there was no call for a national lockdown, and it came upon
                    the citizens to take matters into their own hands in terms
                    of ensuring their safety. The steps taken included: wearing
                    masks, using sanitisers, staying home as much as possible,
                    and sharing resources for people requiring help in their
                    need for plasma, oxygen cylinders etc.

                    While the government was busy campaigning for their
                    elections, the youth took their place at the forefront of
                    the battle against Covid. For every rally they conducted,
                    someone shared a link to a life-saving resource. For every
                    speech they ordained with promises that never seem to come
                    through, another organised a covid relief programme. Through
                    the use of social media, and the public outreach that it
                    gives us from the safety of our homes, the youth decided to
                    take matters into their own hands and actively work towards
                    saving lives. Be it a need for plasma, oxygen cylinders, or
                    any information related to Covid, they have been very vocal
                    about sharing and spreading the word. Twitter was flooded
                    with links to self-compiled documents and excel sheets that
                    listed resource availability. Teenagers were calling
                    hospitals and sources left and right for verification. They
                    formed a chain of communication, delegated responsibilities
                    and amplified any leads and links that could help. Discord
                    servers for volunteers willing to put time and effort
                    started popping up. They had city-wise, state-wise and
                    resource-wise divisions for easier access and more efficient
                    communication. Google links had an organising committee that
                    spent half their waking moment updating new information and
                    revising the exhausted links. Instagram became a forum for
                    amplification as well. People started tagging young
                    influencers for sharing their requests, instead of looking
                    to the government. Every time another story or post came up,
                    there was a flurry of replies with recently verified links.
                    People put the effort into compiling a guided list of posts
                    and accounts that were actively working towards sharing
                    covid resources. The technologically savvy youth started
                    working on better and more efficient forums of aid. There
                    was a software created that would search Twitter hashtags
                    based on key requirements and location to provide the best
                    responses. Someone created an entire app based on meal plans
                    and delivery systems. Another worked on a software that
                    would update automatically as per the nearest medical
                    resources.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Furthermore, with a country divided with polarised
                    perspectives, there has been a lot of misinformation
                    flooding the internet about this pandemic. The youth has
                    done a great job at debunking these myths and trying their
                    best to curb the spread of misinformation to the general
                    public. Their continuous efforts as the situation of the
                    pandemic continues to worsen throughout the country is a
                    beacon of hope for many common people.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But, while they are doing their best to care about the
                    people of the country, who cares for them? It is not just a
                    retweet button or another share option that they are
                    pressing, it is looking at continuous casualties, sifting
                    through the multitudes of hopelessness to come across that
                    one verified information that they give away to a random
                    stranger, never knowing if it is enough. They have to call
                    and get bashed by a dozen hospital staff to get that one
                    correct information about ICU beds that this unknown account
                    asked for because their parents are in a desperate
                    condition. They have to keep the multiple Whatsapp groups on
                    mute because it never stops pinging, people never stop
                    dying. They are we - me, my friends, us, you, your friends.
                    We feel selfish to say we are being affected because we know
                    what the truly infected look like. We think it is wrong for
                    us to take a break from these platforms because what if we
                    could help one more person, reduce one more statistic. We
                    assume we are less than the hurt because we have no
                    documentation to prove that we are collapsing from the
                    inside too. But tell me something, were we responsible for
                    erecting a ₹2, 063 crores worth statue? Did we neglect a
                    decaying medical care system? Have we conducted multiple
                    rallies in the midst of a worldwide pandemic? Then why are
                    we, a generation of barely legal kids doing damage control
                    for it all?
