                    People often assume that queer spaces and queer
                    representation are free of the crippling effects of sexism,
                    it is deemed to only exist in the sphere of heterosexual
                    relationships. However, when we take a closer look at the
                    representation of the LGBTQ+ community in popular media, the
                    signs of sexism are glaringly obvious. From encouraging
                    hostility towards the queer community to portraying
                    inclusive homosexual relationships on-screen, there is no
                    doubt that the world has come a long way in terms of queer
                    representation. However, most advertisements and movies
                    focus on displaying relationships solely between men.
                    Portrayals of romantic or sexual relationships between women
                    are still extremely rare and, when there is any
                    representation at all, it is overly sexualised for the
                    gratification of male viewers and does not authentically
                    represent women of the LGBTQ+ community. How many movies or
                    television shows that are iconic for their positive
                    representation of queer communities only focus on the ‘G’ in
                    LGBTQ+? Why is it harder for us to recall advertisements
                    featuring lesbians or bisexual people than it is to think of
                    ones that feature gay men? How many women who are part of
                    the LGBTQ+ community can say that their sexualities have
                    been accurately represented by popular media even today?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Gay men have historically been featured more prominently by
                    advertisers than women who are a part of the LGBTQ+
                    community. In the 1990s, when brands and advertisers first
                    became aware of the gay market, it was considered more
                    attractive to advertise gay male couples as men were not
                    associated with traditional images of domesticity. To this
                    day, it is still very rare for us to see female couples
                    featured in advertisements, especially those that haven’t
                    been oversexualized to satisfy male viewers. And when
                    lesbians are featured in advertisements, it is
                    stereotypically shown as a huge tragedy for all the men
                    involved. For example, an advertisement by XXL All Sports
                    United, depicts a woman walking through an airport with men
                    lusting after and make desperate attempts to impress her. In
                    the end, when she reveals her sexual identity, the men are
                    devastated because they lost out on a beautiful woman.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In Hollywood too, it has been refreshing to see the increase
                    in queer representation in an industry that has a history of
                    homophobia. But from ‘Brokeback Mountain’ to ‘Call Me By
                    Your Name’, the most iconic queer movies of our time have
                    focused on gay men and male couples. Queer women are
                    massively underrepresented in Hollywood and movies like
                    ‘Portrait of a Lady on Fire’ and ‘Carol’ that do represent
                    queer women are considered to be art and indie films that
                    unlike movies like ‘Love, Simon’, have still not found their
                    way into mainstream media. According to GLAAD, 83% of LGBTQ+
                    representation in media consists of gay men while only 35%
                    consists of lesbians. Here too, representation of queer
                    women is stereotypical, and most lesbian characters fit the
                    Lipstick Lesbian trope of being traditionally attractive and
                    are hypersexualized. More often than not, lesbian characters
                    repeatedly experiment with heterosexual relationships
                    on-screen, making lesbianism seem like a flippant lifestyle
                    choice that can be taken up and dropped whenever one
                    desires. Even more innovative television shows, like ‘The L
                    Word’ hypersexualise lesbians. It is not to say that
                    lesbians are not sexual beings but that their representation
                    cannot be skewed to cater to heterosexual male fantasies.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The lack of strong female lesbian characters in movies and
                    television shows also leads to a dearth of femslash
                    fanfictions on most popular fanfiction sites. Femslash can
                    be defined as a subgenre of slash fan fiction that focuses
                    on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female
                    fictional characters. On most popular fanfiction sites,
                    there are at least more than twice as many fanfictions about
                    relationships between men than relationships between women.
                    For example, records from a popular online fanfiction
                    database, Archive of Our Own (Ao3), show that, as of 2019,
                    41.9% of total fanfictions are about male homosexual
                    couples, 17.6% about heterosexual couples and only 5.8% are
                    about queer females. This is due to the lack of a
                    ‘shippable’ dynamic between female characters and because
                    the media often accords more value and complexity to
                    relationships between men than relationships between women.
                    Women characters also often exist as love interests of male
                    characters, leading to compulsory heterosexuality and
                    squashing the chances of femslash ships becoming canon.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Even in an art form as liberating as drag, intended
                    specifically for queer acceptance, we see a lack of
                    representation. Drag is a gender-bending art form in which a
                    person dresses in clothing and make-up meant to exaggerate a
                    specific gender identity, usually of a sex that is not the
                    same as the one they are assigned at birth. Historically,
                    drag kings were usually female performance artists who wore
                    ‘masculine’ clothing and personified male gender
                    stereotypes, while the opposite applied for drag queens.
                    However, in recent years, with people accepting gender as a
                    spectrum rather than two sets of opposing ideals, there have
                    been trans men, cisgender men and non-binary people
                    performing as drag kings as well. Not only does women’s
                    underrepresentation in front of and behind the camera play a
                    huge role in the absence of drag kings from popular culture,
                    but women assuming male characteristics also denies
                    patriarchy what it sees as traditional gender roles, an act
                    that is often considered intimidating and even terrifying.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Drag kings no longer necessarily exude masculinity by
                    conforming to gendered clothing and have come a long way
                    from dressing up in bland jeans and t-shirts. Today we have
                    genderless drag kings, more effeminate drag kings, and kings
                    who play with a variety of make-up and costumes, giving drag
                    kings as well as the art form more depth. But given that
                    large drag audiences often do not even know who a drag king
                    is and that the word ‘drag’ is still associated with drag
                    queens and extreme femininity, there is still a long way to
                    go.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    What is common when it comes to queer representation in
                    advertising, Hollywood, fanfiction and even drag is that
                    people seem to think that representing just one sexuality
                    and just one gender is enough. Lesbianism has been
                    trivialised by skewed representation in the media. This
                    needs to change. Queer women need to be represented on
                    popular television with just as much value and depth
                    accorded to female relationships as male relationships.
                    While the battle for our rights has come a long way, the
                    fight for representation still needs to be fought.
