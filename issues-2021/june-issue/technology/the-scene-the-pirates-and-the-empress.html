                    For an act of theft as simple and brazen as piracy, the act
                    and its proponents contain surprising multitudes. Like
                    everything else, piracy has changed — one imagines that the
                    floppy disks and hardware wiring skills of the typical 80s
                    pirate would not go very far today. But the typical
                    baton-passing has brought with it a darker, terrifying
                    change- one that needs a great deal of exploration.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In the shadowy worlds of game piracy, there are a hundred
                    layers to explore. On the surface are, of course, the
                    gamers, simply looking to grab their favourite titles for
                    free. But the mechanisms that deliver these coveted “cracks”
                    to them are anything but simple. Beneath the surface, the
                    world of game cracking is dark, ever-twisting, and brimming
                    with petty intrigue — lots of material to be explored.

                    The decade is the 1980s. Apple is a young up-and-comer,
                    Google non-existent, Amazon a river. The “internet” is more
                    like the Usenet, 8-bit is more than a retro style, and
                    dial-up is the name of the game. The dominant names in
                    gaming at this time were Atari and Nintendo, and the
                    industry itself was still in the now-nostalgic golden years
                    of NES and Tetris. As you can imagine, the cracking scene
                    wasn’t brimming with talent either.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But by the end of the decade, things were changing. The
                    Commodore 64, an early model of home computer, had allowed
                    computer gaming (and subsequently, game cracking) to get a
                    very tiny start. Among the amateur computer-centric groups
                    of Sweden, an interest was sparking to see if the
                    rudimentary security of these simple games could be hacked,
                    cracked, and otherwise bamboozled.

                    So, we have the time, a setting, and a nice idea of the
                    climate. Enter the hAxx0Rs. I’ll skip the details of the
                    amateur teenage west-Swedish cracking scene of the mid-80s
                    before them, because, well, it’s details about the amateur
                    teenage west-Swedish cracking scene of the mid-80s, but
                    suffice it to say that one of the active groups at the time
                    was named the West Coast Crackers.

                    “The Scene” has never been noted for its stability, and this
                    was true even before it was known as “The Scene”: for some
                    (undoubtedly meaningless) reason or the other, the West
                    Coast Crackers decided to split up. This left a number of
                    its members without groups, most prominently “№1” and “Sir
                    Galahad”. These two decided to band together, and on 14
                    April 1987, they founded Fairlight. They also decided to
                    switch up their handles, presumably wanting to disassociate
                    themselves from WCC: the founding members of Fairlight now
                    called themselves “Strider” and “Black Shadow”.

                    These two were soon joined by other mainstays of the group,
                    including “Gollum” and “Bacchus”. By the early 90s they’d
                    moved on from the C64 and onto the Amiga and IBM PCs, and
                    they were no longer alone. “The Dream Team” had been founded
                    within Sweden itself, and a similar Swedish group named “The
                    Humble Guys” had already started using NFOs as a convenient
                    way of documenting their releases. However, Fairlight made
                    their mark; they were prolific in their time, and even had a
                    short reign in the PC scene as a collaboration with the USA
                    (United Software Association).

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But as it turned out, Fairlight was just the first of many.
                    By the mid-90s, they’d been driven out of the cracking
                    ‘scene-proper’ by increasing competition and had instead
                    turned into a demo-scene group, creating various pieces of
                    art and music that the vintage cracking scene was famous
                    for. They continue to exist in this niche even today, under
                    the leadership of the now-veteran Bacchus.

                    But back to the warez groups. It wouldn’t be too much of an
                    exaggeration to say that the 90s were the golden age of
                    gaming piracy. Fundamentally, they were the same people as
                    in the 80s: crackers, subculture artists, techies who
                    thought the digital world was the epitome of cool. The
                    Eternal September of 1993 had brought radical change to the
                    fledgling internet, but even though AOL was the new king,
                    the Scene continued partying blissfully uncorrupted.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The winds of change weren’t far off, though. By the mid-90s,
                    the World Wide Web was common knowledge, even outside the
                    academic circles, and the giants of the internet, Netscape
                    Navigator and Internet Explorer, were already tussling for
                    control as usage numbers exploded into the tens of millions.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But the Scene didn’t really start evolving with the times
                    until 1998, 1999 or so. That was the time some of the
                    biggest groups in the history of hacking/cracking were
                    founded: DEViANCE, CONSPIR4CY, Centropy — they dominated the
                    Scene, went toe-to-toe with game developers, movie studios,
                    and anyone who represented Big Media. It was around this
                    time, somewhere in the haze of the 1990s, that the
                    definitive rules and spirit of the Scene started to take
                    shape.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    You have to understand, when talking about “The Scene”, that
                    there is no “The Scene”. The term just refers to the culture
                    as a whole, the entire collection of individuals, groups,
                    aliases, IRC servers, whatever else you can think of.
                    There’s no single ‘Scene’ any more than there is a single
                    Tech Industry.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Like the tech industry, though, the Scene is ever-shifting
                    and ever-dominated, by one group or the other. This ties in
                    fundamentally with its very ethos, its motivation, the
                    reason for its existence. The Scene is not a group of
                    pirates. It’s not even a group of crackers. It’s more like…
                    a bunch of bored, talented people, trying to have fun. It’s
                    hard to explain, especially when the concept of warez scenes
                    has forever been linked to piracy and especially game
                    piracy, but the Scene doesn’t really care about pirating at
                    all; in truth, the piracy is just incidental to their real
                    purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The fact is, to the members of this shadowy Scene, it’s all
                    a game. They choose fanciful names and tags because they
                    can, and it’s fun to have cool names. They crack games and
                    rip films, because they can, and because everyone else
                    can’t. The real purpose of the Scene isn’t to pirate, it’s
                    to prove you’re the best, to write your name in internet
                    history.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Historically, the Scene has been composed almost entirely of
                    young, white men. This wasn’t for ideological reasons, but
                    because of demographics: young white men were overwhelmingly
                    more likely to have access to computers and resources than
                    any other demographic. We borrow a now, distastefully
                    corrupted phrase, “boys will be boys”. The Scene was founded
                    out of that very boyish spirit. It’s not really the shadowy
                    cabal it’s portrayed as; and while their activities are
                    obviously illegal, the spirit of their illegality is less
                    murder and fraud, more.. weed and street racing, underage
                    drinking.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The entirety of the trappings of the Scene are rooted in
                    that boyish, fun-seeking spirit, that underlying desire to
                    have a good time one-upping your rivals, and working on cool
                    projects with friends. The rules they live by — nuking,
                    pre-ing, NFO art, aren’t really necessary to protect their
                    privacy; they’re essentially just race rules. That’s what
                    Scene’s groups really do, race among each other for bragging
                    rights. While governments and media-houses paint them as
                    pantomime villains eating into their profits, the fact is
                    that the Scene really doesn’t care — they just want to win.
                    The members of the Scene are not exactly career
                    intellectual-property-violators. Most have real jobs,
                    careers, families, usually semi-important positions in the
                    tech world. The cracking is just a side-project; they’re
                    hobbyists, using the internet for fun and competition in the
                    same way a DOTA or Fortnite player would.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This ethos of competitive fun served them well for more than
                    a decade — groups like CPY are still active, 22 years after
                    their founding. Though, the Scene isn’t alone on the scene.
                    By the turn of the century, the Scene had hit a rough patch,
                    with the tech bubble bursting, forcing many to focus on
                    their jobs (or job hunts). The reigning groups of the 90s
                    faded away and younger, newer groups started forming with
                    very different ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    These groups, often smaller and more motivated than their
                    older peers, had very different motivations. Whereas before,
                    the Scene carried with it a remarkably flippant “because we
                    can'' attitude, the tone quickly switched to one echoing a
                    more populist sentiment. The Scene didn’t crack for fun
                    anymore (well, not entirely for fun), it cracked for
                    satisfaction. While they continued to maintain their intense
                    privacy, a “stick it to the man” was understandably
                    developing among their ranks.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It’s not that the spirit of fun and competition vanished
                    (not yet anyway). But there was certainly far more of an
                    element of self-satisfaction at the crime than at the
                    display of “skillz”. As the world of video games became
                    rapidly commercialized, so too did the world of video game
                    piracy.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And so, the Scene ruled the 2000s, weathering the dotcom
                    bubble with the same ever-shifting continuity that had
                    withstood the Soviet collapse — the internet is global
                    naturally, and, “i don’t want to pay for that” is about as
                    universal a sentiment gets. The spirit of the high-profile
                    dotcom bubble, in fact, was not so far removed from the
                    spirit of the rather quieter Scene — ride the highs, don’t
                    think about lows.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Scene being in comparative turmoil opened opportunities
                    for others, though. Pirates of the 00s might remember a
                    certain persona called aXX0 (or aXX0) — for most of the
                    2000s, aXXo had replaced the Scene as the leading sources of
                    film and TV piracy in the world; so much so, that at his
                    level, it’s estimated that aXXo films accounted for more
                    than a third of all pirated films.

                    But while the Scene endured, shuffling through various
                    groups and crackers, aXXo quickly vanished. The same has
                    been true of most of the individuals who engage in cracking
                    or piracy outside the scene — without the protection
                    afforded by their strictly-enforced rules, and more
                    importantly, without the motivation of their eternal race,
                    it’s hard for an individual to achieve the same level of
                    mythical fame that CPY or DEVIANCE have.

                    Strangely enough, it was at this peak of the pre-crash,
                    fun-loving age that the rules of the Scene began to harden.
                    The rules that had earlier been simply a mechanism to
                    facilitate competition became rigid and unyielding — a force
                    unto themselves rather than a framework for talent. The
                    Scene’s hierarchy was always complex — due in part to the
                    utter chaos that comes of an entity referred to singularly
                    but in fact completely disparate and only organized in the
                    loosest sense of the word. Over time this hierarchy began to
                    consume itself from the inside out — for a variety of
                    factors.

                    I’ve been using the present tense to refer to the Scene this
                    whole time, but now I’m wondering if the past tense would
                    have been more suitable. The thing is, the Scene as we know
                    it, is a husk of its former self. In its heyday, the Scene,
                    like the internet, was a digital Wild West. But as the
                    internet has matured, it’s become less GeoCities, more
                    Amazon and Linkedin and Cloudflare. And somewhere along this
                    transformation, the Scene was set adrift, torn between the
                    hacking spirit that typified the Fairlights and Humble Guys
                    in the 90s and the all-business ultra-commercialized digital
                    industries of EA and Netflix that rule today.

                    That’s not to say that the Scene’s death was a bad thing.
                    Even ignoring the misogyny and the obvious disregard for the
                    law, the Scene cultivated a horrible atmosphere of toxicity,
                    backstabbing, and sheer contempt that rang out loud enough
                    to hear from inside their digital lead walls. Not to
                    mention, they were, at the end of the day, criminals; some
                    of them, as we would later find out, for far more serious
                    things than breaking open a couple games.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Regardless, the financial crash came and went, and with it
                    many of the same patterns that had followed the dotcom
                    bubble. As the 2010s progressed, the typical shuffling of
                    Scene groups started to show early signs of decline — one
                    consequence of their distrust of outsiders and the dying
                    exploratory spirit of the internet was that far more Scene
                    groups were dying out and not enough were starting up.
                    Somewhere along the line, digital security and the dastardly
                    DRM industry became more important than the ragtag scene
                    that opposed them.

                    But the real death knell of Scene as we know it, rang in
                    2014. An unknown Austrian software company had been working
                    on something special for a while now, and when the curtains
                    lifted on FIFA 15 in September 2014, the Scene had been
                    changed forever, though few knew it at the time. The name of
                    that company was Denuvo Software Solutions.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Their product, the eponymous Denuvo Anti-Tamper, was unlike
                    any game DRM had seen before. It was fiendishly complex,
                    baked into the game itself, incredibly difficult to crack.
                    Overnight, cracking games went from something fun to do with
                    the boys on the weekend to a gruelling, full-time job that
                    would require hours upon hours of devoted research and
                    effort. That was never a strong point within the Scene.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    That’s not to say that they were unable to crack Denuvo.
                    Till date, at least five different groups or individuals
                    have been known to have cracked the infamous software, among
                    them CPY and CODEX, perhaps the best known. However, these
                    victories for the pirates are few and far in between.
                    Frankly, the Scene as we know it, is dead — killed by the
                    heavy hand of copyright enforcement.

                    What has risen from the ashes is a very, very different kind
                    of cracker. What brought groups like Fairlight and even
                    CODEX together was a spirit of competitiveness and fun, of a
                    race to bragging rights. This is far removed from the
                    motivations and actions of pirates today.

                    The harbinger of this seeming doom (though we scarce knew
                    it) was a young Bulgarian hacker named Voksi. This
                    particular haxx0r was, in hindsight, the first of the new
                    breed — an ideological cracker, not a fun-seeking hobbyist.
                    Voksi kept a very high-profile online presence, directly
                    interacting with friends and fans — he didn’t just break
                    Scene rules, he ignored them at every turn, pretended they
                    didn’t even exist. Starting in 2016, just two years after
                    Denuvo’s acquisition, Voksi made a name for himself as a bit
                    of a revolutionary.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    He uploaded videos to YouTube (a few of which, surprisingly,
                    can be found there even today) explaining cracking for the
                    “n00bs”. He cracked games for fun, yes, but he then uploaded
                    them specifically for people to play, rather than to win a
                    race. Voksi, in short, was the beginning of the end of the
                    Scene cabal.

                    Unfortunately for Voksi, he was a bit too cavalier with his
                    IRL identity. He was soon raided by and shut down by his
                    nation’s police, and he subsequently cut a deal that
                    involved giving up his illegal activities. However, he had
                    lasted long enough to make a mark, and perhaps to serve as
                    inspiration to a special someone. Voksi had, in fact, been
                    the prototype crusader cracker that we’re so familiar with

                    irrational and crazed.

                    I know at this point that it feels like I have something
                    against her — I can almost hear the misogynist cancellation
                    bells ringing — but I really don’t. The facts, however, do.

                    EMPRESS’s philosophy is impressive in a very villainous sort
                    of way. She routinely talks about how Denuvo is the scum of
                    the earth, about how they are, essentially, worse than
                    murderers, rapists, drug pushers, and all the other lowlifes
                    of modern society. In the early days, this wasn’t too much
                    of a red flag. After all, the rigours of Denuvo demand
                    someone who can offer this fiendish dedication, one that
                    must necessarily be driven by a burning hatred for the
                    software and its ideology.

                    But EMPRESS’s actions have grown increasingly irrational.
                    Earlier this year, she picked a fight with FitGirl for no
                    apparent reason, despite having collaborated closely before
                    and even allowing her (FitGirl) to get a head-start on
                    repacking RDR (Red Dead Redemption) when she (EMPRESS)
                    cracked it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But the fame (or lack thereof) went to EMPRESS’s head. A
                    short while later, she posted an extremely incoherent,
                    inconsistent lambasting of how FitGirl and her fellow
                    repackers “stole credit” from the crackers (namely, EMPRESS)
                    who “actually did the work”.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This was soon followed by another polarizing move — when
                    EMPRESS cracked Immortals: Fenyx Rising, she then proceeded
                    to rate-limit her seedbox (essentially a server she used to
                    distribute the illegal content), thereby ensuring that
                    nobody could get the whole game for an extended amount of
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The point, it seems, was to not allow repackers to “steal
                    the spotlight”. The actual effect was to tear the pirate
                    community asunder. FitGirl immediately announced that she
                    would stop repacking EMPRESS’s games whatsoever; Masquerade
                    soon followed suit. Many in the pirate community were
                    furious, but, typically for a community built around getting
                    free stuff no matter the means, many sided with EMPRESS.

                    The “millennial” term for EMPRESS’s followers is, I believe,
                    “simps”. A quick trip to r/EmpressEvolution will answer your
                    doubts: the words “goddess” and “marry” are thrown around
                    far too handily for my comfort. But I wouldn’t be surprised
                    if the number of her “simps” would be far higher if not
                    EMPRESS’s next move: pretend she was being arrested.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Yes, a few days after the FitGirl row, EMPRESS posted on
                    reddit that someone (cough FitGirl cough, she said) had
                    “doxxed” (given away her real identity) her to the police
                    and that she was waiting to be arrested. Why the police
                    would allow her to keep using her devices and why they would
                    give her advance notice of her own arrest, was not
                    explained.

                    This, then, is the state of things. 2020 and 2021 have been
                    and will be dark years not just for the game piracy world
                    but also for the gaming world. The only active Denuvo
                    cracker in the world is, shall we say, not completely
                    reliable. The Scene that was relied on and worshipped for
                    decades is a floating corpse. The cracks are in short
                    supply, the anti-cheats aplenty.

                    But as I type this, I have a feeling EMPRESS will never be
                    short of supporters. Assassins’ Creed Valhalla was cracked
                    shortly after Immortals, and one imagines it will not be the
                    last we’ve heard of C00005. Set aside paranoia, possible
                    lying, meaningless feuds. EMPRESS may not be the cracker
                    that the pirates wanted, but she’s the cracker that the
                    pirates need.

                    In the pirate world, nothing matters except skill. For the
                    Scene, skill mattered because it made you top dog in their
                    childish, misogynistic races. Today, skill matters because
                    so few have it.

                    Gone are the days when cracking a game meant getting hold of
                    an early copy and knowing someone who owned an IBM PC. Gone
                    are the idle, bored techies, the college kids drunk on beer
                    and Pacman hacks. Cracking today is more demanding than
                    perhaps any other profession in the software industry, more
                    even than the notoriously painful game development careers
                    and it shows in the crackers. The EMPRESSes of today are
                    fuelled by burning hatred; -men on a mission, a mission that
                    will only end with the collapse of an empire or the arrest
                    of some weirdo.

                    “When the Dark Side rises, the Light Side rises to meet it.”
                    It’s a deep quote and all that, but it’s from Star Wars. I
                    think Fairlight would approve. The arms race that the
                    anti-piracy world (inconveniently, the Dark Side) started
                    has reached its natural endpoint — it has driven the, as
                    they say, casuals out of business, and it has given birth to
                    this entirely new breed that we see today. The zealots. The

                    In the fight of multimillion-dollar game studios versus
                    amateur hackers, the pirates have always been the underdog.
                    But the feeling doesn’t really seem to measure up to the
                    results. After all, for decades and decades, piracy was
                    extremely successful, barely pausing to brush off the
                    efforts of the studios. Now though, things look very
                    different. Call it a lack of perspective, but never before
                    has the world of pirates, crackers, and freebies teetered on
                    the brink as much as it does today, resting, as it does, on
                    the shoulders of one slightly psychotic genius.

                    What’s the solution, you ask? Perhaps I should point you to
                    a certain CD Projekt Red. Despite their very public failure
                    with their flagship game Cyberprank, CD Projekt Red’s
                    ideology is one that I could see being the future of a
                    sustainable gaming world. There is value in piracy, even to
                    the sellers — after all, there’s no such thing as bad
                    publicity.

                    Though illegal gaming is naturally an area that’s not
                    exactly bountiful with research, internet wisdom says that
                    piracy rarely, if ever, hurts a game’s sales. Those who like
                    it usually buy it if they can afford it, and if they can’t,
                    they wouldn’t anyway. The distinction between losses and
                    unrealized profits is, surprisingly, better understood by
                    internet pirates than multibillion-dollar anti-cheat
                    companies.

                    the NSA. Maybe Todd Howard will actually release an Elder
                    Scrolls game that doesn't contain the word ‘Skyrim’. Two
                    years ago, nobody would have predicted EMPRESS. Maybe in two
