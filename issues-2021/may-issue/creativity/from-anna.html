                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;I am so very sorry for not having replied to your last
                    letter until now. Everything has been so busy here, but I
                    had no intention of worrying you. I received your letter a
                    week ago and yes, I am quite well, as I hope you are. At
                    least as well as one can be in a war-stricken country.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;I am so saddened and enraged to hear that the
                    publishers have threatened to suspend your column in the
                    newspaper! Word of your campaign for equal pay for female
                    factory workers has even reached our small village here;
                    just the other day, I passed by a group of women in the town
                    square who were discussing one of your pamphlets.Women are
                    finally starting to see things for what they really are, and
                    I think that’s what all these big newspaper men are afraid
                    of. Why ever else would fighting for half the population’s
                    rights be deemed ‘controversial’?
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;The war is only becoming worse than ever now. There is
                    hardly any time for us to eat and sleep. At least three
                    dozen soldiers are being brought in every day and so many of
                    them are already dead. We barely have enough equipment and
                    staff to help everyone in this small school that they have
                    turned into a hospital. There are only about a dozen nurses
                    here, including myself, and we are having to make beds out
                    of tables and chairs for all the wounded coming in. And do
                    not even get me started on the food shortages.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;Back here at the hospital, no one can think about
                    anything but the war but anyone trying to dismiss women’s
                    rights with frivolous excuses about how the war is bigger
                    and more important is simply trying to delay and deny the
                    change that is sweeping through our nation right now. In
                    fact, I would do a lot to think about anything other than
                    the war and death and politics right now, if only for a few
                    moments. And almost all of us here believe that it is more
                    important for stories and articles like yours to be
                    published now because, like you said, with all the women who
                    are losing loved ones and family and income in such times,
                    they need help and they need their rights now more than
                    ever. I can only hope that more women will rise to be
                    leaders like you in this fight.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;As for everything you told me about President Wilson’s
                    decision in your last letter, I am so glad that the chances
                    of our victory and of the war ending sooner than either of
                    us anticipated are so much higher now. Catherine, the girl
                    here at the hospital I told you about in my last letter, her
                    husband in the army tells her that their lieutenant informed
                    their platoon that the United States would be entering the
                    Great War soon. I am sure that will tip the balance in our
                    favour and that we will finally be able to defeat the
                    Germans and perhaps we will even see each other sooner than
                    we thought! Of course, I am too scared to get my hopes up
                    right now. The wounded and the dead are still arriving in
                    astonishing numbers and Dr. Philips says that none of this
                    will be getting much better for a while, so it is hard to
                    believe that this war might actually be over soon. I wish
                    you were here, for your presence and your strength would
                    have made all of this so much easier. I know there is
                    nothing you can do, I really do know that, but I still miss
                    you so very much, more than I can put down in words, and the
                    only thought that keeps me going through the tragedy of it
                    all is the thought of seeing you again when this war is
                    finally over.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;As for my brother, neither my mother nor I have heard
                    from him in months. Mother is worried sick, she writes all
                    the time and I hardly have enough time to respond to all her
                    letters in between tending to one wounded soldier and the
                    next. The girls here tell me that it is very likely that he
                    just is not receiving our letters, it seems that that
                    happens a lot with soldiers at the front, but I cannot help
                    but feel my heart fill with terror every time I think of him
                    and wonder what I would do if he were to suddenly show up
                    here one day with all the other dead and wounded soldiers.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;But enough about me. How have you been? I hope you did
                    not take what those ghastly publishers said to heart. I know
                    you have never been one to worry about what others think of
                    you, but in these times, I know it is hard to keep our
                    spirits up. The women here love your writing, they wait to
                    read your column every week, and if the publishers cannot
                    see how good you are, I feel sorry for them. As for me, I
                    wait with bated breath every Wednesday for the newspaper
                    because reading it feels like hearing your voice, and I feel
                    like I can almost see your eyes light up as they always do
                    when you are talking about something you are passionate
                    about. It feels like having a part of you with me, if only
                    for a short while. Your column is so good and it’s inspiring
                    so many people, love.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    &ensp;I am afraid I have to end this here now, my break is
                    almost over, but know that I miss you and I love you very
                    much and I cannot wait to see you again. I can only hope
                    that we will meet each very soon. Until the next letter,
