                    From the earliest of times, the Japanese have celebrated the
                    beauty of seasons and have thoroughly recognized the
                    poignancy of their inevitable evanescence. These
                    celebrations were mainly in the form of rituals and
                    festivals that adorn the Japanese calendar quite
                    endlessly—from the welcoming of spring at the lunar New Year
                    to the offerings made to the harvest moon. Immense
                    sensitivity to seasonal changes has always been a major part
                    of Japanese culture. Poetry proved to be the earliest model
                    of this representation, and in response, painters and
                    sculptors formed images that could be ultimately traced down
                    to seasonal inspiration.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This attention to seasonal change stems partly from the fact
                    that Shinto—Japan’s native belief system—paid great
                    importance and heed to the topic. Most Japanese books from
                    the time explain that because Japan was an agricultural
                    country, it depended deeply on climate and of course,
                    seasons. Thus, it became a common Japanese myth that instead
                    of trying to ‘fight’ nature, the Japanese lived in harmony
                    with it. The literature thus born out of this notion was
                    called fūdo.

                    Man’yōshū 万葉集 (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) edited
                    in the eighth century, is the earliest evidence of poetry
                    that has significant exploration of the four seasons. Books
                    eight and ten of the Man’yōshū consisted of 31 syllable
                    poetry (waka) arranged by seasonal topic in seasonal order.
                    Kokinshū 古今集 (Collection of Japanese Poems Old and New)
                    which was edited in the tenth century, further refined the
                    seasonal arrangement found in the Man’yōshū.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Kokinshū 古今集, in particular, had two books that
                    extensively consisted of poems about spring. In total, there
                    were 134 spring poems in the Kokinshū. The seasonal motifs
                    that were usually associated with spring were mainly—plum
                    blossoms, warbler, cherry blossoms, yellow kerria
                    (yamabuki), and wisteria. Each season, as represented
                    through the Kokinshū was also said to progress in three
                    gradual phases. In the case of spring, there would first
                    come the full bloom of plum blossoms signifying the start of
                    spring, then it would move on to cherry blossoms, and lastly
                    to wisteria and yellow kerria that would signify late
                    spring.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Although it is clear that poets and artists favored spring
                    and gave it stark importance hinting that perhaps spring was
                    long, Japan’s climate said otherwise. Spring was exceedingly
                    short lasting for a month or so, before giving way to a long
                    and indispensable summer. In literature, it was exactly the
                    opposite. Summer was reduced to a short and inconsequential
                    season, while spring was given undivided attention. The love
                    for spring poetry was heightened to the point wherein,
                    winter poetry most often represented winter as a sign of how
                    close the spring season is.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    By the thirteenth century, seasonal motifs became codified
                    and structured, and almost all poets and artists
                    incorporated these motifs to specify seasons. Seasonal
                    motifs were not only restricted to flowers now, the use of
                    birds as seasonal motifs, were also introduced. For Spring,
                    these birds were specifically— bush warbler (uguisu),
                    pheasant, and skylark (Hibari). These motifs were extremely
                    influential and became a part of Japanese culture. Many,
                    many festivals take place in the spring. For example, the
                    Hina-matsuri (ひな祭) is celebrated in late spring.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Edo period proved to be one of the more peaceful and
                    economically stable eras, wherein the arts flourished. The
                    use of seasonal greetings and seasonal phrases were
                    especially popularised. These seasonal phrases or kigo 季語
                    became an essential part of the seventeen-syllable haiku
                    poems. During the same time, Satoyama (literally meaning
                    farm under the mountain), which explored the life outside of
                    the cities in the form of art and literature, heavily
                    flourished. Their seasonal motifs were different. The coming
                    of spring in Satoyama was distinguished by the presence of
                    chestnuts and barley, sparrows, and swallows.

                    In modern Japanese literature, one will often find the
                    sentiment of loss being represented when it comes to the
                    portrayal of spring, as most authors believe that recent
                    technological advancements have hindered the beauty of
                    nature. However, there also exists a perspective, in which
                    Japanese authors try to incorporate the ancient sense of
                    'harmony with nature to the Western humanistic view of
                    humankind. In modern times, the use of kigo in literature
                    has severely declined and most seasonal motifs have changed
                    as the Japanese have migrated to the Gregorian calendar.

                    What persists, is the impulse, the influence of all these
                    poems, stories, and art. Spring in Japan is still celebrated
                    widely, albeit not in the same way it was a couple of
                    hundred years ago. The words to portray the awe and wonder
                    one feels as they gaze upon the fleeting beauty of a cherry
                    blossom can be found in plenty, many of which are still
                    being written. The art is made to capture a single scenery;
                    a single moment of this painstakingly short season will
                    never be enough. With each passing year, there is an influx
                    of new seasonal motifs, new paintings, new poems—and as long
                    as there exists an eye to witness Spring, in all its
                    wonderful glory, these artists and their thoughts will keep
                    producing material worth dissecting and studying; for a
                    long, long time.
