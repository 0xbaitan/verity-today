                    The internet surely has not forgotten the pop culture
                    phenomenon that was the surprise announcement and release of
                    Taylor Swift’s ‘folklore’, her eighth studio album that
                    charted alternative folk music completely unexpected from
                    the pop star. Mere months after ‘folklore’ (an Album of the
                    Year nominee at the 2021 Grammy’s), Swift leisurely dropped
                    another bomb, this time to do with her ninth album,
                    ‘evermore’. In her own words, she found herself “standing on
                    the edge of the folklorian woods with a choice: to turn and
                    go back or to travel further into the forest of this music”.
                    Fortunately for the rest of us, she chose to wander deeper
                    in.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While ‘folklore’ represented the muted beauty of spring and
                    summer, ‘evermore’ completes the seasonal anthology with its
                    depiction of wild autumn and winter. The songs on the album
                    have a certain liberation to them, and indeed the metaphor
                    used by Swift herself about the forest of music is the best
                    way to describe its quality: ‘evermore’ exhibits
                    similarities in style and content to its sister ‘folklore’,
                    but this time it is untamed and illimited in its tone. With
                    energetic drum beats and syncopating piano melodies joining
                    the calmer symphonies, the resulting album is one that
                    personally appeals more than ‘folklore’ to my pop
                    sensibilities.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Undoubtedly, Swift has stepped up her game in terms of her
                    lyrics as well as the stories she manages to convey. Like
                    its predecessor, ‘evermore’ intertwines tales of fiction
                    with the musician’s own life, although the stories are now
                    more mature and melancholic. Long gone are the days of
                    teenage love triangles and dancing at the disco, with Swift
                    exploring broken marriages, winter depression, and even
                    murder.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Yes, you read that right: ‘no body, no crime’, a
                    collaboration with HAIM, features a twisted tale of an
                    affair gone wrong, culminating in the narrator murdering the
                    adulterer in order to avenge her fallen friend. With twists
                    and turns fit to rival any full-length murder mystery novel,
                    I had my jaw on the floor as Swift unravelled her account in
                    a country-pop ballad, accompanied by police sirens and
                    dialogue to propel the plot-line. Meanwhile, ‘cowboy like
                    me’ chronicles a romance of two swindlers who trick elderly
                    rich folks into relationships, only to steal their wealth
                    and run off together. Akin to the ‘august’- ‘cardigan’-
                    ‘betty’ trilogy of ‘folklore’, ‘dorothea’ and ‘tis the damn
                    season’ narrate Dorothea’s return home for the holidays,
                    after her attempts at making it big as an actress in Los
                    Angeles. At home, she rekindles a love affair with her high
                    school boyfriend who has been living in their small town all
                    these years.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The lead single, ‘willow’, presents a plucky exploration of
                    the attempts at first trying to enter a relationship with
                    someone. The mind-games and “bait and switch” used in such
                    flirtatious advances are seen by Swift as a witchy ritual to
                    enchant your crush into falling in love with you. At the
                    other end of the spectrum, ‘happiness’ offers a glimpse into
                    the end of a relationship. While it is a breakup song, it
                    lacks the quintessential bitterness that Swift allegedly is
                    famous for. Instead, ‘happiness’ is a mature track that
                    refuses a black and white view, recognising that in spite of
                    the pain and misery of a broken heart, there is still joy
                    and comfort in looking back on a failed relationship.
                    Dichotomies of this sort are found several times in
                    ‘evermore’, especially with ‘marjorie’, a song addressed to
                    Swift’s late grandmother. The song sees the singer regret
                    her inability to be with Marjorie anymore, who used to be an
                    opera singer. In fact, her vocals have even been sampled in
                    the final chorus, when her operatic soprano accompanies
                    Swift opining that she could hear her grandmother singing to
                    her after all these days.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The more upbeat brilliance of Jack Antonoff’s production
                    shines through in ‘gold rush’, my personal favourite track.
                    It sees the speaker dive into a glittery quickfire daydream
                    about a possible life with her potential love interest, only
                    to decide at the end to snap out of it and return to her
                    senses. Swift expertly uses the California Gold Rush as a
                    metaphor for her complex romance, when individuals from all
                    across America moved to the state in order to get their
                    hands on the gold. Here, the significant other is compared
                    to the gold who is wanted and desired by everyone around
                    him, while the narrator is forced to look on in jealousy.
                    The track abounds in cleverly crafted lyrics and angelic
                    choirs that mimic the sparkle and shine of real gold.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Such themes of bitter love affairs echo throughout the
                    album, culminating in ‘tolerate it’, inspired by the novel
                    ‘Rebecca’ by Daphne du Maurier. The primary conflict occurs
                    between the narrator and her husband who refuses to
                    “celebrate” her love, and only “tolerates” it. It is a song
                    that is sure to hit hard for anyone who has ever felt
                    patronised and belittled by others, describing the speaker
                    waiting by the door like a “little kid” for her partner who
                    is “so much older and wiser”. By far, though, the climax of
                    moroseness comes about only in the second track, ‘champagne
                    problems’. Co-written with her longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn,
                    Swift croons a piano ballad about a rejected marriage
                    proposal by a woman suffering from mental health issues.
                    Unable to come to terms with the end of the relationship,
                    the proposer’s friends and family brush it off as being
                    caused by the singer’s alcoholism (hence, champagne
                    problems) and her failing mental health. With deceptively
                    simple production featuring a straightforward four-chord
                    piano instrumental, it transports the listener to the
                    imagery within the very song, especially with an impassioned
                    bridge that has Swift rattle off the entire story in the
                    space of a single minute. In my opinion, ‘gold rush’ and
                    ‘champagne problems’ mark the very apotheosis of Swift’s
                    songwriting abilities in ‘evermore’, with creative concepts,
                    catchy melodies, and production that shines on its own
                    without detracting from the lyrics and melodies.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In my previous analysis of ‘folklore’, I had remarked that
                    the final track ‘hoax’ was strange as it ended on an
                    uncharacteristically miserable note. Perhaps it was an
                    intentional nod to the album being only the first of a
                    duology, as the eponymous closing track of ‘evermore’
                    provides the much-needed closure. Unlike most of the other
                    songs, ‘evermore’ is one narrated by Swift herself, set
                    within a period of depression and blues propelled by the
                    current lockdown as well as the 2020 presidential elections.
                    Initially, it starts off despondent, claiming that her “pain
                    would be forevermore”. Another melancholic piano ballad, the
                    slow chords suddenly give way to a more upbeat riff, penned
                    by none other than Alwyn himself, and Swift’s vocals are now
                    replaced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. The sudden increase
                    in pace is seen to symbolise Swift’s change of mood from her
                    earlier dejection, until the piano slows down to its
                    original tempo once again, albeit with a crucial change: she
                    ends the album with the hopeful closing line, “I knew this
                    pain wouldn’t be forevermore.” While the album as a whole
                    may have been even gloomier than ‘folklore’, its ending
                    betrays its true nature as an album of finding light amidst
                    all-encompassing darkness.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    On ‘evermore’, Swift makes a subtle reference to her sister
                    album in the lyric, “My mind turns your life into folklore”,
                    which perfectly sums up the pursuit of art and creative
                    expression, and hence the purpose of the two albums
                    themselves. In all her songwriting glory, Swift has the
                    power to transmit the lives of those around her into a
                    long-lasting legacy of musicality, but the true beauty of
                    the lyric lies in its more mundane applications. We need not
                    be the artist of the decade to possess such abilities, but
                    the mere remembrances in our very mind are enough to create
                    fables and tales to be passed down from generation to
                    generation. Through her album duology, Swift drives home the
                    power of storytelling as a vessel to immortalise our loved
                    ones in the form of folklore, to flourish and thrive within
                    memories and art for evermore.
