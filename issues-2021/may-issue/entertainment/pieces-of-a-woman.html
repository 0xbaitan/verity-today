                    There is a strange, lovely quality about this film. It’s
                    delicate, aware of sound and touch and smell and growth and
                    life; sometimes, it’s so delicate, it’s inert: characters
                    stare, run, take trains, drive cars and walk a lot as Howard
                    Shore’s beautiful score swells and ebbs on the soundtrack,
                    and nothing much happens. It’s about the inertia of grief, a
                    kind of grief that many of us are lucky enough never to
                    experience, a grief that numbs and dumbs and tears frayed
                    relationships.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This is a very visual movie; dialogue is frequent, but so
                    are silences. We see close-ups of characters’ faces, but
                    also of their necks, lips, shoulders. There are long, long
                    takes, in which the camera glides around, choosing whom to
                    observe and not always picking the one we, the audience,
                    might, preferring to linger on a wordless face and not on
                    the person speaking. The film’s most significant scene, its
                    pièce de résistance, is a literally breath-taking
                    twenty-three-minute one-take in which Martha Weiss (Vanessa
                    Kirby in a deeply committed performance), surrounded by her
                    partner Sean (Shia LaBeouf, more on whom later) and midwife
                    Eva (Molly Parker), gives birth at home. Martha begins to
                    experience contractions and from that minute, we follow her
                    as she collapses onto the sofa, writhes on the floor, is
                    transferred to a full bathtub, and then makes her way to her
                    bed, as Sean and Eva hover around. The mechanics of staging
                    this huge scene are tough to imagine, but the three
                    performers – especially Kirby – pull it off admirably. It
                    isn’t an easy one: there are close-ups of Martha’s swollen
                    belly, we see her bite Sean’s thigh in pain, we see the baby
                    begin to emerge, we are witness to Martha’s boundless
                    distress. I will never know what that pain is like although
                    Kirby has not delivered a child herself, but it is an
                    extremely convincing sequence. The consequences of this
                    painful delivery effect and inform the rest of the film.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    It’s also visual in the sense of recurring motifs, most
                    significantly a bridge that Sean is working on building
                    (he’s a construction worker). We meet the characters once a
                    month from September to March, and each time the date
                    appears on the screen there’s a shot of the progress on the
                    bridge’s construction. Sean also brings up resonance, the
                    scientific concept involving vibrations and rhythm. What
                    this bridge metaphor means is never made explicit (almost
                    nothing in this film is), but I got the sense that the
                    building of the bridge is a reverse reflection of Martha and
                    Sean’s relationship: as one progresses steadily to
                    wholeness, the other fractures. And the other motif that we
                    see is apples. Apples embody life and growth (especially in
                    a biblical sense), and the smell of a newborn is compared to
                    the smell of apples. The silent resilience and renewal of
                    the fruit and its seeds is something, perhaps, that Martha
                    both finds solace in and aspires to.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But the most enduring theme, of course, is grief. Sean and
                    Martha grieve differently, cope differently, and sometimes
                    mirror one another. Martha speaks very little. Sean comes
                    off as something of a dick: he even refers to himself as
                    boorish. And it’s impossible now not to look at this
                    character in light of FKA Twigs’ lawsuit accusing LaBeouf of
                    a ‘relentlessly’ abusive relationship. The two of them were
                    in a relationship in which LaBeouf subjected her to assault
                    and violence, sexual, verbal, mental. In the film, Sean at
                    one-point forces himself on Martha. She is initially
                    resistant, but eventually compliant; his is a raw sexual
                    energy as he insists, she touch his penis and as he tries to
                    yank her pants off. She asks that he give her a second to
                    take them off herself, but he stalks away. It’s an
                    unsettling scene and the filmmakers make the slightly
                    problematic decision to stay with Sean, weeping in the open,
                    after this scene. Is his bad behaviour being passed off as
                    grief? Again, it’s not made explicit, but I was left both
                    confused and uncomfortable. Martin Scorsese, who is one of
                    the film’s executive producers, said the film examined a
                    “moral conflict with all its nuances, drawn out with care
                    and compassion but without judgement”. Director Kornél
                    Mundruczó and writer Kata Wéber (the film opens with both
                    their names under the joint credit “a film by”) don’t judge
                    their characters, but I don’t think we can help ourselves as
                    viewers.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And life, as ever, goes on. When you experience
                    insurmountable grief, do you ever find happiness again? And
                    how do you help a grieving person? I don’t know, and nor
                    does anyone in this movie. Pieces of a Woman doesn’t tell,
                    it shows – sometimes viscerally and sometimes so quietly
                    that we almost don’t notice. And as it slips by, culminating
                    in a dreamy closing scene where the apple metaphor reaches
                    its apotheosis, it gives us a little window into the life of
                    a woman. How we interpret what we see through the window is
                    left for us to decide.
