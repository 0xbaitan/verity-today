                    2020 has not exactly been the perfect year for the film
                    industry. Empty cinema halls, jobs lost, premieres
                    cancelled, and deals made by executive producers with Hulu-
                    hell, it may have been one of the worst years. That is
                    essentially why Christopher Nolan’s (director of Inception,
                    Dunkirk, The Dark Knight Series, etc.) brand new production
                    Tenet- which has been released in Indian cinemas like a
                    black sheep in an array of postponed releases, catches the
                    spotlight and as explained in this article- may remain with
                    it. Also, just a heads-up, for the sake of Indian formality,
                    I say we assume Tenet has gone hot in India only because the
                    theatres haven’t seen many other movies come in and also due
                    to the fact that Nolan is one of the most popularly esteemed
                    directors in the circuit. Not at all because Dimple Kapadia,
                    a Bollywood icon has a major role in the film, and this
                    would make the walls of our recently empty theatres resound
                    with restless whistles. Totally not. Got it? Cool, let’s
                    start!
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As the name clearly fails to suggest, TeNeT is an
                    action-thriller blockbuster, infiltrating the Sci-fi Genre
                    very explicitly- your classic Nolan combo. It explores a
                    turn in the career of a secret intelligence agent (played by
                    John David Washington (BlackKKlansman))(working for the CIA)
                    , who after an encounter with a group of terrorists in an
                    Opera House, takes a suicide pill after being caught and
                    wakes up on a government-owned ship. Disclaimer at this
                    point- CIA’s suicide pills are apparently worse than their
                    inability of letting leftist Presidents live. A superior
                    tells Washington’s character that he has been chosen for a
                    special directive, the directive being saving the present
                    from the future. Fancy. The protagonist accepts his fate,
                    and goes on a rummage to deconstruct the agenda of this
                    threat for himself. This leads him to Bombay (Nolan very
                    completely, iconically, symbolically, originally achieves
                    Indian culture by showing us the rainy streets of Bombay
                    filled with busy vendors selling homogenous puchkas :D)
                    where he is approached by a man who introduces himself as
                    Washington’s ally, called Neil (p.b. Robert Pattinson.)
                    After that, the movie sees it’s ascending action roll off
                    with special effects dispersed on a frantic overdose as
                    Washington progresses on his mission and finds Kat, the
                    female lead (played by Elizabeth Debicki), and wife of hunky
                    Russian arms producer, Andrei Sator (who as we find out in a
                    few, is much more than a shabby gun manufacturer), our
                    antagonist.

                    That’s where I end with the plot description, having laid
                    down the base of it for you if you haven’t seen it. To
                    examine Tenet, we have to first understand that this is a
                    coming-of-age movie which is consolidated in two genres-
                    Sci-Fi and Action. Therefore, we will analyse &#8212;
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    a) The action as it takes place on screen, how it is
                    complemented by cinematography and special effects,
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    b) The development of the plot points and incorporation of
                    the sci-fi elements into that development, and it’s
                    subsequent conveyance on screen.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    If Tenet is truly a movie which will describe Nolan for the
                    succeeding ages (though we really do prefer other
                    productions of his to take up that role, it’s really tough
                    to judge) and establish itself as one of the many great
                    films in the sci-fi genre, it’ll be because of it’s
                    graphics, the fact that it was shot on almost only IMAX
                    Cameras, and the visual effects Nolan easily plays around
                    with as if they’re his trademark puppets and he, a seasoned
                    puppeteer. To give you a better understanding of how Tenet
                    does at visual effects, you’ll have to know the scientific
                    basis the plot builds itself upon.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    So basically- the future is super-pissed with the present
                    because of the intensive deterioration of climate conditions
                    artificially brought about by us, and in the process has
                    declared war upon us. This is done by inverting a technology
                    called “inversion’ by which objects and people go backward
                    in time by reversing their entropy, and using our antagonist
                    as a middleman- a facilitator. Through this the sociopaths
                    in the future are manufacturing lethal bullets (and other
                    stuff), inverting them, and in the process, flooding us with
                    pretty dangerous tangible material with reversed entropy- or
                    whatever they call it. Not only that, there are literally
                    several inversion machines of the same technology in the
                    present world by going through which you can invert your
                    entropy.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In the movie, many characters go through these machines. A
                    lot. And boy, does Nolan have fun with it. You basically
                    have a totally new concept besides time travel, and based on
                    this concept you reverse whatever takes off a scene you
                    have, both in terms of the order of events and the position
                    of objects. This allows Nolan to direct an encounter of
                    Washington’s character with himself, cars turning over on
                    themselves, the sun going from the west to east instead of
                    the other way around, etc. In Tenet’s last sequence, since
                    time moves in different directions for non-inverted and
                    inverted persons, it’s a mania on the screen. Audiences see
                    the same building implode and explode simultaneously simply
                    because the implosion happens in universe A while the
                    explosion happens in universe B. The executive team has
                    greatly capitalized on the opportunity the science, whether
                    credible or incredible, presents the directors with- and has
                    gone all in on making Tenet a modelling of how cinematic
                    technology has progressed. Here, Tenet has my go-ahead as a
                    Nolan classic, though it moulds itself more as a spy
                    thriller in the initial portions.

                    However, that’s not all. The plot in terms of its direction
                    is essentially where the problem is. Remember, the plot is
                    not simply the content which fills the movie and gives
                    reason to the action- but the very arrangement of that
                    content and in the tone it leads the viewers to the content.
                    For me, the plot of Tenet was really disjointed. For the
                    first 1 and a half hours of the movie or so, it is quite
                    basically impossible to understand what is going on- and why
                    it’s happening. Yes, it is understandable that Nolan directs
                    complex movies and confusion is just a conventional
                    give-and-take concept, but the confusion which normally
                    arises out of a Nolan movie is usually &#8212;

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    i) at the end of it

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    ii) is more curiosity than confusion
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In this case, you’re staring at the screen watching all the
                    fascinating takes with the visual effects doing their part,
                    but at the same time, there is no real interest to carry you
                    away to home-base because knowledge generates interest- and
                    all the knowledge of the movie’s proceedings come in it’s
                    last quarter- with too much responsibility given to the
                    climax and the post-climactic scenes of the film to
                    delineate why everything that has taken place, has taken
                    place.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    While movies like Inception and even Interstellar do have an
                    enormity of concentration of content in climactic scenes,
                    they usually have a fair amount of distribution of
                    exposition through character interactions, scripted
                    dialogue, and the informative exploration of scientific
                    bases. In Tenet, you have nothing like that until the very
                    last moments, with all the characters engrossed in ignorant
                    action and the movie barely giving space to the viewers for
                    them to register proceedings. That is, for me, the main
                    reason why Tenet does not and cannot get as much clout as
                    other Nolan movies- besides it’s untimely release in the
                    middle of pandemic panic.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This does not at all discredit the genius of the content
                    Nolan has transformed from thought to Tenet, and frankly,
                    the last quarter of the movie is quite a pleasure. If we all
                    had his perspective, and his knowledge of the plot
                    beforehand, the movie would be an instant turn-on. But we
                    don’t, and only a few including Nolan do. That is the
                    primary factor behind the title of this article: Tenet

                    Despite my amateuristic criticisms, Tenet is an indicator of
                    not only how much Nolan has seasoned his talents of
                    creation, but also how much the film industry has achieved
                    and how easily it tackles concepts of physics unfathomable
                    to the human eye. While being a production pretentious
                    viewers would applaud at the intermission and call “genius”
                    while not understanding the half of it, Tenet is a
                    production you cannot help but grin at and appreciate when
                    the credits roll.
