                    The 2021 West Bengal State Assembly Elections might put that
                    claim to the test. The elections, which took place across
                    294 constituencies in eight phases from 27th March to 29th
                    April, has been one of the most aggressively-contested state
                    elections in our country’s recent history, and possibly one
                    with the most far-reaching consequences. The main political
                    parties involved are the Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has
                    been the ruling party in Bengal for the last ten years, the
                    Left Front, which governed Bengal for thirty-four years
                    before the TMC came into power, and the Bharatiya Janata
                    Party (BJP), which currently controls the Central Government
                    of India. In the parties’ ongoing contest to govern West
                    Bengal, the welfare and interests of the citizens have been
                    forgone in favour of gaining power and control over the
                    state. A case in point would be the several rallies packed
                    with thousands of supporters that have been held by each of
                    the parties in the middle of a pandemic that is only
                    becoming deadlier by the day.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The Indian Constitution guarantees the universal adult
                    franchise as a fundamental right to every Indian citizen
                    above the age of 18. Yet, five people were killed at a
                    polling booth in Sitalkuchi on 10th April, 2021. Reports of
                    repeated bombings in front of people’s houses in villages,
                    death threats to voters and confiscation of Voter ID cards
                    are all examples of how political parties are trying to
                    discourage civilians from voting by inducing violence and
                    fear in an attempt to prevent the balance from tipping in
                    favour of the opposition.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The sanctity of the electoral process and the freedom to
                    exercise one’s right to vote are not the only aspects that
                    have been compromised in this election. Even the style of
                    campaigning has reached a new low. Political campaigning now
                    involves using divisive policies to polarize the electorate
                    and disrupt the communal harmony in the state. In fact, this
                    election marks one of the rare instances in West Bengal’s
                    history where communal issues have been the focus of a state
                    election. Attempts to appease certain communities, encourage
                    religious fanaticism, and make blatantly sexist remarks at
                    rallies full of thousands of people, are all new to the
                    ethos of the Bengal elections. The political parties have
                    resorted to catcalling and blatant ridicule of their
                    opposition in an attempt to promote their party, with
                    ministers making a mockery of one another in their political
                    speeches, effectively premising the entire election on
                    slander and insult.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Election campaigns are supposed to be based on election
                    manifestos where the contesting parties outline their plans
                    for the state and promises to bring benefits to the people
                    if they are elected to power. The political leaders are
                    expected to explain this agenda to the voters in order to
                    secure votes in their favour. However, in the current
                    scenario, concrete agendas and plans for the people’s
                    welfare have been replaced by empty promises that hardly
                    sound convincing. Instead, parties have focused on spending
                    their resources on buying the support of candidates and
                    voters.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The West Bengal elections hold immense national and
                    historical significance for the BJP right now. If the BJP, a
                    relatively new contender in Bengal, succeeds in defeating
                    the TMC, it would not only bring another state under their
                    control but also make them seem invincible, crushing the
                    spirits of all opposition-run states in India. On the other
                    hand, if the TMC were to successfully resist the BJP and win
                    this election, it would lift the morale of other opposition
                    ruled state governments, which is important because
                    democracies should be premised on strong opposition parties,
                    different state governments and different opinions.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The 2021 Bengal election is like no other because this
                    election will determine what will happen to the state of
                    West Bengal over the course of the next five years. Since
                    BJP and TMC’s policies and goals for the state are
                    fundamentally opposed to one another, it has led to extreme
                    polarisation between the supporters of these parties in
                    Bengal. In Mamata Banerjee’s opinion, these elections are
                    more important than any in Bengal’s history as they are a
                    fight for the state’s ‘somman’ (respect), for Bengal’s
                    pride, history and heritage.
