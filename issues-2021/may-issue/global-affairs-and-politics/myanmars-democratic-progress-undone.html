                    Most people should have heard about the absolutely terrible
                    situation in Myanmar, where the military forces, known as
                    the “Tatmadaw”, led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing,
                    staged a coup d’état on February 1, 2021, against the
                    government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, seizing control of the
                    country and proclaiming a state of emergency for the next
                    year. Since the uprising, the people belonging to all
                    sections of society, be it doctors, teachers, monks, social
                    activists, etc. have risen up in protests against the
                    forceful seize of the country by the military, but the
                    military have fiercely and violently suppressed the public
                    protests that demand the release of their leader Aung San
                    Suu Kyi, who has been held in detention by the Tatmadaw
                    since the beginning of the coup. Not only have the military
                    taken control over the country but have also arrested
                    several political leaders and have levelled charges such as
                    import of illegal communications equipment against Aung San
                    Suu Kyi. But before we delve into the implications of the
                    coup, let us get some history out of the way to give you a
                    better understanding of the situation.
                  </p>
               
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Myanmar, (then Burma), gained independence from British rule
                    in 1948 to become a democratic republic. But in 1962, the
                    political regime changed as the military forces staged a
                    coup to replace the democratic system as they scrapped the
                    Constitution and established a ‘junta’ i.e a military
                    government, which is practically a dictatorship. The next 50
                    years, which I would personally call Myanmar’s dark phase,
                    saw the military close the country to the international
                    community and crack down hard on regional rebellions. It
                    also soon became clear that the military had a vendetta
                    against the ethnic minorities, which were gravely oppressed
                    and deprived of basic human rights. However, during the late
                    1980s and 1990s, there was a meteoric rise in popularity of
                    Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for
                    Democracy (NLD), which aimed to liberate the people and
                    bring about reforms. She rose to prominence among the 1988
                    public protests against the junta caused by problems like
                    corruption, faulty economic policies and food shortages. As
                    one might have expected, the military violently suppressed
                    the protests, placed Aung San Suu Kyi in detention and
                    continued to hold political and economic power over the
                    country.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Then came in 2010, what is known as “Myanmar’s Experiment
                    with Democracy”. Under the pressure of numerous sanctions by
                    the international community and international condemnation
                    for their violent killing of Buddhist monks during the 2007
                    Saffron Revolution, the military decided to hold multi
                    party, free and fair democratic elections in 2010. Also, the
                    military’s refusal of foreign humanitarian aid during the
                    cyclone Nargis 2008 and other humanitarian issues like
                    violent killing of ethnic minorities forced the
                    international community to push for change.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    However, the aim to elect a true people’s government failed
                    as the 2010 election was characterized by military
                    interference as the military enacted election laws which
                    disqualified Aung San Suu Kyi from running for President and
                    there was proof of polling station irregularities, with the
                    UN and many other nations dismissing the election results as
                    fraudulent. The military-backed USDP (Union Solidarity and
                    Development Party) was proclaimed the election winner
                    although the NLD had boycotted the election. Thus, this
                    election could arguably be considered a ploy by the military
                    to legitimize its power under the new Constitution they
                    brought into force in 2008. In the 2015 elections, however,
                    Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won in a landslide and she assumed
                    the position of State Counsellor and a role as the leader of
                    the people. The subsequent years until 2020 saw some change
                    and progress under her government although her powers were
                    fairly limited considering the provisions in the 2008
                    Constitution which gave the military some exclusive
                    political powers
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The reason given by the Myanmar military is largely a faulty
                    claim that the 2020 Myanmar elections, won by Aung San Suu
                    Kyi’s NLD, were rigged and they had uncovered signs of
                    “terrible fraud”, although no substantial proof was
                    presented backing their claim. Yeah, this reminds me of
                    Donald Trump as well. The Myanmar military said that it was
                    acting in the interests of the people of Myanmar and would
                    hold free and fair elections post the 1-year emergency
                    period. Ironic, isn’t it? The military is promoting people’s
                    interests by killing hundreds of innocents peacefully
                    protesting.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    For me, this coup, as many reports have stated, might be a
                    desperate attempt by the military to hold onto their
                    political and economic power over the country as Aung San
                    Suu Kyi’s popularity continued increasing with her pushing
                    forward constitutional reforms and social reform plans which
                    would have benefitted ethnic minorities. Another theory,
                    though it might seem a bit far-fetched, is that General Min
                    Aung Hlaing acted in his own personal interests with the aim
                    to salvage his political career and maintain his power.
                    However, the internal deliberations and discussions of the
                    military have been highly secretive and thus, whatever might
                    be the military’s real reasons behind the façade of “holding
                    free fair elections”, isn’t yet known. The reason may also
                    be, as what was stated by an Independent analyst on Myanmar,
                    Larry Jagan, “The game plan appears to be silencing Aung San
                    Suuu Kyi and preventing her from having any political
                    future.” Also, to defend the decision to stage a coup, the
                    military-owned Myawaddy TV station cited an apparent
                    provision in the 2008 Constitution which allows it to
                    declare a national emergency.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In most nations, the military is but an armed force serving
                    the country and acting on the commands of the government,
                    but there is a starkly contrasting scenario in this regard
                    in Myanmar. In essence, the military in Myanmar has taken
                    the form of a dominant political party acting at the behest
                    of an authoritative controlling figure. As per the 2008
                    Constitutional provisions, the military have been accorded
                    25% parliamentary seats irrespective of the election results
                    and they hold important portfolios in the Cabinet such as
                    defense and immigration. The military have used their
                    parliamentary seats to their great advantage, as they have
                    been successful in blocking many significant reforms, both
                    constitutional and social. The military also has two
                    well-established conglomerates and therefore their influence
                    extends to the economy as well. Thus, the military’s
                    extensive powers have allowed them to act only in their
                    individual self-interests and retain control of the country.
                    The only thing to ponder over is whether it is justifiable
                    that the military itself functions as a ruling political
                    party in a country, especially when they have committed
                    numerous human right violations and the general public
                    themselves do not consent to their governance. Yes, there
                    have been instances of junta governments being established
                    in the past but they usually emerged only for a few years
                    during a period of crisis for the country and did not rule
                    for decades.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The military have made moves to violently suppress the
                    pro-democracy peaceful protests with civilian casualties
                    exceeding 600 and thousands being injured. They have also
                    banned public gatherings, periodically suspended internet,
                    social media and telephone services, and have also banned
                    all domestic and international flights. Unfortunately, the
                    military attacks only keep escalating on the resilient
                    public, who still protest in large numbers against the coup.
                    However, now, the front liners in the protests, as stated in
                    the New York Times, have transformed into a “guerilla force”
                    with them trying to defend the people against the military
                    crackdowns and protesting against them with a basic form of
                    warfare by attempting to sabotage the military facilities.
                    The few pro-democracy politicians, that haven’t still been
                    arrested or detained and the human rights activists are
                    rallying the people against the military and urging them to
                    raise their voices against the state of lawlessness that the
                    military seems to be representing right now.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The United Nations, the United States, the European Union
                    and various nations, within weeks of the coup, condemned the
                    military’s actions and demanded that they release Aung San
                    Suu Kyi immediately and honor the results of 2020 election.
                    They have also pressed hard on the agenda of human rights,
                    considering that the military has often displayed a kind of
                    “genocidal nature” against ethnic minority groups like the
                    Rohingya Muslims, the Shan and the Kokang. A formal United
                    Nations Joint Statement condemning the military’s actions
                    and threatening further actions that are within the ambit of
                    the UN Charter was vetoed by China and Russia, who have
                    friendly ties with Myanmar and consider them an important
                    strategic partner in Asia. China and Russia vetoed the
                    resolution on the grounds that its tone would rather worsen
                    the situation than do any good.

                    the 15 nations of the Security Council, although it has been
                    drafted in a milder language and does not condemn or
                    threaten the military perse. The Presidential Statement is a
                    step below a formal resolution but it still holds
                    significance as it does become a part of the official
                    records of UNSC. The Presidential Statement, although weaker
                    than the initial proposed move, called for the release of
                    State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint,
                    stated that it supports Myanmar’s democratic transition and
                    stressed on the need to uphold democratic institutions,
                    refrain from violence and fully respect human rights. Any
                    other action in this stage by any country or the UN would
                    hold immense international implications as any action even
                    subtly threatening the military would be harshly met by
                    countries like China and Russia. But, at the end of the day,
                    something must be done and I am backing the United States,
                    the UK and the European Union to push forward on their
                    stances and hopefully improve the situation in Myanmar.
