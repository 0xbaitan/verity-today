                    We have spoken about the different components of mental
                    health/illnesses, in order to create awareness and stimulate
                    readers to engage more with the said issue. However, there
                    is indeed one facet of mental health, we have not shed much
                    light on. Like most aspects of our life, mental health too
                    has been incredibly capitalised over the years, therefore
                    undoubtedly inhabiting a very big yet regrettably flawed
                    infrastructure.

                    Now, if you are one of the 1.5 billion Instagram users in
                    all likelihood you must have come across at least one post
                    preaching about “acknowledging mental illness and seeking
                    professional help”. However, “seeking professional help”
                    does come at a cost, and this cost has both sociological and
                    economic impact on every single one of us. Delving deeper,
                    we come across the two folds of the same problem, the first
                    and obvious one being - stigma. It is to no surprise that
                    mental health therapy in India exists in a highly
                    stigmatised space, and opting for therapy usually prompts
                    people to use labels like “crazy” or suggesting alternative
                    solutions like “doing yoga” or the classic “just stop using
                    your phone”. And this is stacked upon another very crucial
                    problem, the cost of therapy and the commitment it takes to
                    see the gradual results making access to therapy not only
                    more difficult but also very expensive.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    India being a country where 20% of its population
                    (approximately 650 million people), suffer from some kind of
                    mental illness, there are no major health insurance policies
                    that provide mental health coverage. In 2017, the government
                    passed The Mental Healthcare Act, which mandated insurance
                    companies to cover all kinds of mental illnesses. After the
                    act was passed the Insurance Regulatory and Development
                    Authority of India (IRDAI) made it obligatory for all
                    insurance companies to include mental illnesses in their
                    offerings. And these decisions were backed by a 2018 survey
                    conducted by the National Health Survey, which concluded
                    that over 150 million citizens were in dire need of
                    immediate intervention for mental health disorders and most
                    of these needs remained unattended. Irrespective of all
                    these obligations none of the insurance companies in India
                    cover mental illnesses at all. Now, the obvious question is
                    - why are there no government policies to rationalise
                    therapy costs? and the most “disappointed but not surprised”
                    answer to this is corruption. Before opting for medicines
                    like antidepressants and sedatives it is crucial to choose a
                    non-drug alternative like mental health therapy.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    However, our government does not support this methodology
                    simply because they do not make money out of it.
                    Antidepressants and sedatives are sold at high margins by
                    the biggest pharmaceutical companies, making them one of the
                    most profitable drugs. However, non-drug alternatives like
                    therapy would hamper their revenue. Reports are stating that
                    most government-funded psychiatric wards do not have basic
                    facilities to provide therapy. And even after these
                    horrifying reports, the government continues to support this
                    holy grail of capitalism at the cost of making their
                    citizens more vulnerable to substance abuse, mental illness
                    and various other disorders.

                    Irrespective of the prevailing economic hardships, the
                    different layers of discrimination based on sexuality,
                    caste, gender, and religion has indefinitely made the mental
                    health infrastructure further marginalised. A recent study
                    by Sobin George titled “Reconciliations of Caste and Medical
                    Power in Rural Public Health Services” published in 2019
                    illustrates caste discrimination in healthcare services in
                    India. According to Gorge, discrimination essentially occurs
                    on two levels- inclusivity and treatment, where there is
                    insidious almost normalised discrimination. A large number
                    of mental healthcare providers in India come from non-SC/ST
                    backgrounds insinuating the lack of representation or
                    inclusion in the system. And concerning discrimination in
                    terms of medical interactions, respondents have reported
                    experiencing differential treatment from higher-caste health
                    workers. Including limited interactions, avoidance and
                    inadequate time for consultancy, resulting in constant and
                    several visits to attain the right diagnosis.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The mental infrastructure is very closely intertwined with
                    human well being, especially in the ongoing pandemic where
                    millions are left vulnerable and more susceptible to mental
                    illnesses. Therefore, it is only through the correct policy
                    framework, implementing programmes that take a strong
                    intersectional and a community-centric approach is the bare
                    minimum the government can work on to fix this broken
                    infrastructure. Acknowledging and acting upon your privilege
                    to provide adequate resources to people coming from
                    marginalised socio-economic backgrounds can go a long way as
                    well.
