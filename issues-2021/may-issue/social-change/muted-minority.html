                    India is witnessing a surge in violent crimes against women
                    and especially, women from minority communities. From
                    physical assault to verbal harassment to sexual abuse, the
                    statistics keep on rising and there is little done to battle
                    them down, apart from censoring the female population of
                    India.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    All of us girls have grown up with comments about how our
                    pride has never risen from between our legs, or how our
                    entire persona can be deduced by our dress code, and
                    everything in between. And this is a childhood narration
                    from the central hub of a metropolitan city, so what about
                    our rural counterparts?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    As per the last central survey of India, the female literacy
                    of rural India had increased to 56.8% in comparison to the
                    male literacy rate of 72.3%. This number is after the
                    numerous initiatives of the government that incentivise
                    education with money, so children, often the girls, are
                    registered with proxy attendance to only avail the money
                    promised without ever showing their face in the institute.
                    And the gap, thus produced between the two genders, does not
                    only symbolise who can write their name and who cannot, but
                    also represents who understands their rights and who does
                    not. For how do you speak up against a crime if you do not
                    know whether there is a law to protect you from it or not?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The National Crime Records Bureau of India stated that for
                    every one crime recorded against a woman from a minority
                    community, there are over thirty that go undocumented, and
                    not just from the victim’s side. If a woman does overcome
                    the fear of being ostracised and stigmatised by the incident
                    and goes to file a report, she is met with harassment at
                    every stage. Often the police refuse to accept sexual
                    harassment FIRs, particularly if they are filed against
                    upper-caste or well-known men of the community. They either
                    send the woman away with false hopes only to discard the
                    allegation or threaten her themselves. So how do you fight
                    for the law, when the law enforcers are against you as well?
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In the Hathras case of 2020, a Dalit woman was brutally
                    raped by a group of upper-caste men. The police refused to
                    accept the report and even burnt the body in the middle of
                    the night against her family’s wishes. There were mobs of
                    people rallying in support of the rapists. This incident
                    took the nation by storm and numerous people came out to
                    raise their voices against this cruelty. Not even a week
                    later, in Balrampur, a 22-year old woman was raped by two
                    men, to which the police let out a press statement that the
                    victim had apparently tried to force one of the rapists to
                    marry her as if this claim could justify the deed. In the
                    same week two more rape reports, an eight-year-old and a
                    fourteen-year-old surfaced in the same state. A state that
                    has a chief minister like Yogi Adityanath who has been known
                    to make statements like “women need protection, not
                    independence”, and yet he still remains in power.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And this is not the only failure of the people responsible
                    for the workings of our country. In January 2021, the Bombay
                    High Court ruled that groping without skin-to-skin contact
                    cannot be categorised under sexual assault. Yet, women every
                    day talk about the daily harassment they face on public
                    transports, a daily commute of the working class. How many
                    steps can we take to shift away from a straying hand till
                    the court finally decides our safety is not in the comforts
                    of clothes. The Supreme Court threatened a rapist to marry
                    his victim or he would lose his government job. Yet, people
                    claim sexual assault complaints ruins a man’s life.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    We act surprised every time a new rape case graces the
                    national media as if the ever-rising unsolved cases with the
                    accused roaming free are not ample evidence against the
                    clear partiality of our society. We stop going to the
                    streets or holding candle vigils as soon as the media drops
                    the case because we are used to it. We are used to being
                    abused, harassed, violated.
