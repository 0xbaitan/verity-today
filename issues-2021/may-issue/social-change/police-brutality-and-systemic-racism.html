                    Statistics clearly show that Black and Hispanic people are
                    2.5 times more likely to be killed by the police as compared
                    to white people. We’re all acquainted with the unfortunate
                    story of George Floyd. He was suffocated to death by Derek
                    Chauvin- a white police officer, who had knelt on his neck
                    for a continuous period of eight minutes and forty-six
                    seconds. He was unarmed, cooperative and had pleaded to be
                    released multiple times because he couldn’t breathe. When he
                    had been approached by officer Lane, another white police
                    officer, he had had a gun drawn on him, the reason for which
                    was never provided by those responsible. “If it had been a
                    white person charged with counterfeiting, they would
                    casually laugh about it later on, sitting at a barbeque
                    party among friends.”, a Twitter user said - I think that is
                    quite true, can you recall if we have ever heard the news of
                    a white man being killed for being cooperative and unarmed
                    during an arrest made under the suspicions of having used a
                    counterfeit 20$ bill?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black medical worker was shot
                    to death in her Louisville Apartment on the night of March
                    13, 2020. The officers involved claimed to have announced
                    themselves clearly as the police, whereas, on the other
                    hand, Kenneth Walker, Breonna’s boyfriend who was present
                    along with her in the apartment, disputed the claims, saying
                    he had never heard them say anything of the sort and as they
                    both woke up to loud banging on their door, he had fired a
                    shot from his licensed handgun hitting one of the officers
                    in the knee due to a justified suspicion of being under
                    threat from Breonna’s ex-boyfriend who may have broken in.
                    The police responded with 32 shots, in exchange for the one,
                    six of which hit Breonna instantly killing her. Not a single
                    officer had used body cameras hence impeding the public from
                    determining what exactly had happened. One of the officers
                    had been charged with ‘wanton endangerment’ for having fired
                    so blindly that a few of them landed in the neighbour’s
                    apartment, while the other two officers were not charged at
                    all. Not a single one of them was explicitly charged with Ms
                    Taylor’s death.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Ramarley Graham, a mere teenager of 18 had been killed by
                    the police in a similar setting. During an NYPD narcotics
                    squad surveillance of a Bodega near his home, Graham had
                    been allegedly seen adjusting the butt of what seemed to be
                    a gun on his waistband and upon being approached, had
                    allegedly run into the home of his grandmother, Patricia
                    Hartley. Surveillance footage from just outside the front
                    door of the building proved otherwise as it showed Graham
                    approach the building at a walking pace, manifesting no
                    signs of urgency whatsoever. Upon gaining forceful entry
                    into the building, an officer had run up to Hartley’s
                    apartment, knocked down the door without a search warrant or
                    announcing that he was a police officer and discovered
                    Graham attempting to flush a bag of marijuana down the
                    toilet. He was shot square in the chest, without warning,
                    with his younger brother and grandmother as the audience.
                    Upon further investigation, he was found very clearly
                    unarmed.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    On 22 November 2014, when a police car was passing by the
                    snowy field at Cleveland Park, Tamir was throwing snowballs
                    with a toy pellet gun. Officer Timothy Loehmann shot and
                    murdered the 12-year-old within two seconds of leaving his
                    team car. Let me rephrase that for you - “A 12-year-old
                    black kid was killed by a white police officer for playing
                    with a toy pellet gun, completely threat-less and
                    unsuspecting.”
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old black man was killed by
                    Minnesota police officer Kim Potter. She was supposed to
                    have tased him. Surveillance footage of the incident clearly
                    shows her screaming the word “taser” thrice as per protocol
                    before tasing someone. Why did Wright die then, it was just
                    a taser right? Turns out, Kim Potter had ended up firing her
                    service Glock 9mm pistol instead of her taser. She later
                    said in her defence, that she had mistaken her pistol for
                    her taser and only realised what she had done after the
                    ‘accidental’ discharge. The bullet hit Wright at very close
                    range in the chest area. A few things to note here. All
                    officers are required to wear their firearms on their
                    dominant side and their tasers on the opposite side, to
                    deter such fatal mix-ups from taking place. Moreover, a
                    Glock is significantly heavier than a taser and even someone
                    who has not trained with the weapons for as long as a police
                    officer does would easily be able to tell the difference in
                    weight. Tasers are also coloured very differently, mostly
                    neon or yellow so that officers can clearly distinguish
                    between their taser and service pistol which is a metallic
                    grey or black. The bodycam video released by the press for
                    public eyes shows Kim Potter, the culpable officer, holding
                    the gun in front of herself, pointing it at Wright quite a
                    while, long enough to be able to tell that it was her
                    service pistol and not her taser given that she was looking
                    right at it.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    All of the evidence that I put forward, points to an
                    overwhelming amount of apathy towards the victims, a blatant
                    disregard for standard protocol, instances of misinformation
                    in the reports of the incidents in order to cover up ‘slip
                    ups’ and almost implied intentions of termination. It makes
                    you wonder whether they were actual accidents in situations
                    of ‘high pressure’ or instincts stemming from internalised
                    racism leading to the taking of deliberate decisions. The
                    statistics outline and also prove that in the amount of
                    civilian and criminal deaths caused per annum due to police
                    brutality, the number of deaths of black people outweighs
                    the number of deaths of the racially oppressive races. There
                    is only one thing that we can attribute those statistics to
                    and that, very obviously, is systemic racism. “We have
                    enough evidence that tells us that action needs to be
                    taken,” says Justin Nix, a criminologist at the University
                    of Nebraska Omaha. “One thousand deaths a year does not have
                    to be normal.”
