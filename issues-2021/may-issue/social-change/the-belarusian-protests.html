                    Adding on to yet another unsurprising edition of blatant
                    police brutality being pursued by governments, we have the
                    recent Belarus protests. On 9th August 2020, Belarus was set
                    to have its presidential elections with two key candidates-
                    Aliaksandr Lukashenko or as he is fondly known, Europe's
                    last dictator, who has been reigning for over 26 years and
                    Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. Lukashenko has won every
                    presidential election since 1994, with all but the first
                    being labelled by international monitors as neither free nor
                    fair. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was a stark contrast to
                    Lukashenko. A stay-at-home mother, she felt compelled to
                    challenge Lukashenko's rule when the established opposition
                    figures, including her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky, a
                    blogger, were jailed or forced into exile ahead of the vote.
                    She called for change after years of economic stagnation and
                    repressive rule and gained popular support. However,
                    Lukashenko was declared the winner in the election and
                    credited with 80% of the vote.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This unleashed an unprecedented wave of peaceful protests in
                    Belarus against the electoral results that were marred by
                    widespread fraud. To stifle the protests, the Belarusian
                    authorities engaged in a widespread, brutal crackdown on the
                    peaceful protesters, detaining thousands of people and
                    subjecting hundreds to torture. Security officials and
                    police violently dispersed the protests using excessive
                    force and rubber bullets, stun grenades, tear gas etc. By
                    mid-November, police had detained more than 25,000 people
                    holding them in degrading conditions. It is alleged that the
                    police held detained the protesters for days in overcrowded
                    cells, often denying them food, water, medical assistance,
                    and access to the toilet. Former detainees have reported
                    beatings, prolonged stress positions, electric shocks, and
                    in at least one case, rape. The Belarusian Association of
                    Journalists documented 336 detentions and 60 incidents of
                    violence against journalists in the months after the
                    presidential vote. The authorities opened hundreds of
                    politically motivated criminal cases against political
                    opposition figures, protesters, and their supporters, civic
                    activists, and human rights defenders. At least 121 are
                    behind bars awaiting trial, according to Belarusian human
                    rights group Viasna. Despite this intimidation, tens of
                    thousands continued to demonstrate peacefully for fair
                    elections and justice for the abuses. For now, Lukashenko
                    has prevailed, relying on the support of Russian President
                    Vladimir Putin.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    More than six months of protests have left Belarus’ economy
                    on its knees, and even a $1.5 billion bailout from Russia
                    last September has not succeeded in stabilizing the country.
                    The European Union has not recognised the election outcome,
                    calling it unfree and unfair, and imposed sanctions on
                    Belarusian officials involved in the post-election
                    crackdown, as have the United States and the United Kingdom.
                    They condemned the violence, detentions, and internet
                    shutdowns. In November, an expert report based on an
                    investigation by the Organization for Security and
                    Co-operation (OSCE) in Europe found “massive and systemic”
                    human rights violations and called on Belarus to hold new
                    elections. In September, the United Nations Human Rights
                    Council (UNHRC) got involved as well.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    In a show of outrageous high handedness, Tikhonovskaya was
                    forced out of the country by the government. However, if
                    Lukashenko believed that banishing Tikhanovskaya would end
                    her threat to his rule, he was wrong. Tikhanovskaya has been
                    negotiating with international leaders from exile. One key
                    strategy, forged in regular talks with U.S. and E.U.
                    officials, is to push for far tougher economic sanctions on
                    Lukashenko’s government and international recognition for
                    Tikhanovskaya to lay claim to the governance. The task of
                    knitting together a viable political opposition from outside
                    the country is quite daunting but Svetlana Tikhanovskaya is
                    not one to be discouraged easily. She is calling on
                    Belarusians to take to the streets this week and revive the
                    mass protests that swept the Eastern European country last
                    fall. It seems only a matter of a short time before the last
                    dictator of Europe has to kneel before the real authority-
                    the people.
