                    The European Super League is a travesty. It really is. To
                    lean into a reddit stereotype, its the Americanization of a
                    profoundly unamerican sport. What the ESL proposes is not
                    just a break away from the long-standing region-based
                    structure of football, but also a model that is
                    fundamentally incompatible with a sport rooted in the joy
                    and tears of the working-class lifelong fan.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The premise of the ESL is this: most of the value of
                    region-based leagues come from a few clubs (the Manchester
                    Uniteds and the Real Madrids). As a consequence, these clubs
                    have decided that if they’re creating most of the revenue,
                    they’re entitled to most of the revenue. So far, so good.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    <img
                      src="/articles/May2021/Sports/ugly-ugly-moneyball/img2.jpeg"
                      alt="image"
                      class="img-fluid"
                    />
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    The only problem is the way this revenue is actually
                    created. Revenue comes from fans, and fans flock to football
                    for the emotion, not the commercialization. Football is
                    completely unlike, say, tennis or golf, which are
                    fundamentally sports of beauty and grace, sports which are
                    popular for cultural reasons. Football is an emotion sport.
                    Yes, there’ll always be the Twitter accounts praising Leo
                    Messi for that incredible bit of skill and yes, most people
                    value aesthetic as much as results, but the average football
                    fan does not tune in every weekend because the players are
                    just so smooth. There’s a reason literally half the world
                    follows football, and that’s because it appeals to something
                    every primal, very unevolved in us.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    From hooliganism to pub culture, this primalism is evident
                    in every single aspect of The Beautiful Game. It’s in the
                    screams of delight when the ball thwacks against the net,
                    the flamboyant celebrations, the violent confrontations and
                    boiled-over tensions that mark the very best matches. And
                    most importantly, it’s in that feeling you get when your
                    club wins. It’s the reason fans say “we” instead of “they”.
                    Football is part of its fans’ identities. Whether it’s in
                    the devotion that fans show for decades, or the humble
                    beginnings that characterize so many of the best players,
                    football is nothing if not the connection it has with its
                    fans.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And football is dying.

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Gunnersaurus was sacked. Wimbledon turned into a franchise.
                    The humble beginnings are mostly forgotten, reserved for an
                    occasional mention at an award ceremony. Over the past
                    decade, football has been dominated by a tiny number of
                    clubs: Manchester City and United, Barcelona and Real
                    Madrid, Paris St Germain, Bayern Munich, Juventus. Half are
                    owned by billionaires, and the other half spend as if they
                    are, too. It’s even worse at the
                    not-quite-dominating-but-good-enough-to-try level. Kroenke
                    Sports Enterprises. Suning Holdings Group. Red Bull GmbH.
                    These are hardly names that evoke what you’d call the spirit
                    of football. The cynic might say that football is already
                    dead, bankrupt morally if not financially.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    And what’s even worse is the fact that the ESL is stupid. It
                    doesn’t even make logical sense. It’s one thing to be an
                    evil, money-grubbing villain, it’s quite another to be
                    genuinely bad at your job. In the long-term, it’s going to
                    wreck every club in the ESL, wreck football as a sport (or
                    atleast curb it from achieving its potential as a truly
                    global phenomenon), and probably stunt a generation’s worth
                    of players along the way. The only ones to benefit will be
                    the billionaire owners… and something tells me that’s not
                    unintentional.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    You see, the ESL’s premise is awfully flawed. Its defenders
                    have tried to use trickle-down economics (of all things) to
                    justify it, the idea being that since the ESL will give 15
                    clubs loads and loads of money, and they’ll have to spend it
                    buying players from the smaller clubs for loads and loads of
                    money, the smaller clubs will also benefit.
                  </p>

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    This is stupid. This is like saying we should donate all our
                    money to Jeff Bezos, because he’ll have to spend it one day,
                    so we’ll obviously get rich when he buys things from us.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    What will actually happen is what’s been happening at Old
                    Trafford for the past decade. The owners (and they are such
                    a bunch, got everything from genocide to financial fraud on
                    their resumes) will drain the broadcasting money from the
                    club’s pockets. With no impetus to achieve, since they’ll be
                    guaranteed a spot in the moneybags league anyway, they’ll
                    completely ignore the need to invest in their squads,
                    ultimately hurting the quality of the game.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But that’s just from the perspective of the big clubs. It’s
                    much, much worse from the perspective of the small clubs.
                    You see, no matter what the neo-Reaganists tell you,
                    trickle-down economics doesn’t work. In the short-term,
                    clubs excluded from the ESL will be immediately up against
                    it, especially when their domestic leagues start getting
                    devalued in favour of the mega-matches. But even if they
                    manage to survive the lean years soon to come, over the
                    long-term, their extinction is practically guaranteed.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Because even if most of the ESL money goes on to line
                    billionaire pockets, the sheer magnitude of these clubs’
                    windfalls means that their infrastructure will soon balloon
                    far, far beyond the capabilities of any other club. With
                    infrastructure comes training facilities, globe-spanning
                    scouting teams, lots and lots of visits to Dr. Cugat. It’s
                    the defining feature of capitalism: the more money you have,
                    the more money you can make.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    That right there wrecks any possibility that an ESL-having
                    model of football could possibly be sustainable in the
                    long-term. The City Football Group already has a network of
                    clubs across the world which they can use to snap up
                    footballing talent. With the ESL, such strategies will
                    magnify tenfold, allowing these 15 clubs to grab all the
                    talent right from the parks and the academies across the
                    world, eliminating the “feeder-clubs” altogether and
                    wrecking the extremely fragile ecosystem of football, the
                    lower tiers of which depend heavily on producing and selling
                    quality footballers to pay their expenses.
                  </p>
                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    But the most severe problem of all, the one which will
                    inevitably affect even the ESL clubs, is a problem of
                    appeal. The magic of football, the romance of it, comes from
                    anticipation. Football is defined by its derbies and its
                    rivalries because it hits just the right note of rarity.
                    It’s the same reason the World Cup is such a big deal: it
                    doesn’t roll around every three months, you have to wait for
                    it. And this isn’t just something people say: If you want
                    proof, ask the fans of Barcelona and Real Madrid who were
                    around for that famous four-Clasico month. On paper, that
                    stretch should have been among the greatest times in history
                    to be a football fan: The two best teams, featuring the two
                    best players under the two best managers, were playing four
                    times in three weeks.

                    If the ESL gives us twenty “big” matches a year, one after
                    the other, it will not (despite the opinions of dear Andrea
                    and Flo) make the fans happy. It will make the fans
                    disinterested. And in the grander scheme of things, that is
                    suicide. The justification for the ESL seems to be that the
                    younger generation wants it, and that Asia and America are
                    ripe for a megafranchise. They are wrong. As a member of the
                    exact demographic they are targeting, I assure you that they
                    are incredibly wrong. Football’s romance, the essence of its

                    match, none of them are. They will kill the entire brand

                    through league position, but in the market. A natural
                    consequence of there being one high-profile league with
                    extreme amounts of money to throw around should be that all
                    the top players are attracted to it (ala the EPL in the
                    2000s and 2010s). Unless UEFA and FIFA go ahead with their
                    threats to ban players from the World Cup, this will

                    Unfortunately for every other club in the entire world, this
                    creates a closed economy. If the ESL clubs can produce the
                    majority of the talented players (because they’ll have the
                    money to outbid every other academy and scouting
                    institution), and they’re also the biggest market for
                    talented players, what we’re looking at is a league-wide
                    version of Chelsea’s loan system, where all the talent is
                    hoarded by a small group of clubs which deprive smaller
                    clubs of vital revenue while also stagnating the development
                    of most of its youth products for the sake of conserving
                    value. Nobody wins, except the billionaires.

                    But back to the finances. Per present reports, it seems that
                    US banking firm JP Morgan will provide initial financing for
                    the ESL in the form of 6 billion dollars worth of grants to
                    the clubs involved. 3.5 billion of this is essentially a
                    bribe, given as “infrastructural” and COVID-recovery grants.
                    The prize money and other related add-ons come to almost
                    triple the current UCL, all of which is to say that these
                    clubs will be swimming in money. Surely if the top
                    institutions have the money to spend on football, football
                    will improve?

                  <p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white">
                    Of course not. It’s important to remember that the ESL is a
                    closed league. Manchester United’s poor showing in the Prem
                    under the Glazers has already told us that owners value the
                    steady stream of broadcasting and bribe money far, far
                    higher than the meagre additions of performance-related
                    grants. It seems that Manchester United’s long-standing plan
                    of being just good enough to bank on the UCL without having
                    to spend enough to perform well in it, will be the
                    dominating strategy.

                    Inevitably, therefore, football will stagnate. Instead of
                    driving player compensation higher and higher as is
                    happening in the present bubble, player compensation will
                    remain at the same level while all excess revenue is drained
                    off into the owner’s accounts. A few owners with
                    non-traditional goals (sportswashing) will probably end up
                    serial winners — not because they’re better, but because the
                    other clubs won’t want to spend the money to compete.

                    right off the bat. That number makes no sense from a
                    sporting sense — every sporting competition, including the
                    UCL, typically changes format practically every decade. But
                    it does make sense financially. These owners see their clubs
                    as long-term investments, not football clubs. 23 years is
                    the amount of time they want to siphon off all the club’s
                    money — Peter Lim style — and then retire to the Bahamas

                    succesful, it is for different reasons entirely. American

                    Football is a sport about emotion, about the memorable
                    moments, not about the ads and the half-time shows and the

                    Yes it is. But it is not the world’s most popular sport, not

                    achieved, precisely because it lacks that special emotional
                    appeal. It is completely rational to expect that by the end
                    of the ESL’s 23 year term, football will have shrunk, not
                    grown, financially. People will still buy their tickets and
                    they’ll still wear the shirts, but not enough of them, not
                    nearly enough to justify this incredible 6 billion dollar

                    upper-mid-table, probably make maybe half a billion Euros.
                    Great returns. They’ll grab a nice and flashy player on a
                    Neymar-level deal, someone exciting, someone to keep the
                    kids tuned in. Maybe Sancho, or Haaland. But they won’t buy

                    The next year.. you get the point. That is not football.
                    That is a business. If you drain the excitement of the CL,
                    and you kill all the underdogs, and you stop any risk of
                    promotion or relegation, why oh why would anyone possible
                    pay to watch you? This is nothing but a last gasp attempt by
                    failing clubs to protect their fat cheques.

                    Notice those red arrows next to United? That means bad. That
                    means that this model of using clubs as cash cows is
                    unsustainable, and it leads to stagnation of the sport, and
                    it is everything that a club should not be doing. Instead,
                    they’re doing everything they can to get the financial
                    muscle to keep doing it. This is bullshit.

                    Manchester United, just like the rest of the stodgy old
