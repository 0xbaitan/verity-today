                <p>
                  I am a sort of a person who for some reason, has always had
                  some complication or the other with just having something as
                  simple as sound, uninterrupted sleep. There’s this ongoing
                  joke among my friends about how my sleep is like streaming
                  music on Spotify for free. Be it a nightmare, an odd dream
                  which was not particularly unpleasant, or just the
                  uncomfortable temperature of the room, there has always been a
                  factor leading to my sleep deprivation, which in turn started
                  affecting my mood during the day. Now, behold, the big
                  however, when I was thirteen, I had an odd experience.
                  Actually, a very scary one. I distinctly remember, having a
                  bad dream and then suddenly waking up. I was not entirely
                  conscious though, in fact, I had to process for a good sixty
                  seconds about whether I was awake or asleep. After finally
                  having processed the fact that I was awake, I attempted to
                  turn over. Now here’s the shocking part, I could not move a
                  muscle, however much I tried. The best way to describe it
                  would be, resting your palm on a table, folding your middle
                  finger in and trying to lift your ring finger without
                  disturbing the other fingers. I was inevitably terrified out
                  of my wits and felt a sinking feeling in my chest, so I
                  attempted to scream for help. Complete failure. I lost my
                  voice, I couldn’t even whisper. I stayed still for the next
                  couple of minutes and was about to cry. I managed to move my
                  neck and finally, I was able to regain the strength to move my
                  body parts again. This is not where it ends, I was too
                  terrified to fall back asleep again and thirteen year old me
                  made the rookie mistake of looking up symptoms.
                </p>

                <p>
                  “Sleep paralysis”… okay, fair enough. I scrolled down a little
                  further and there it was, the three words that still haunt me
                  to this day
                </p>
                <p>Sleep Paralysis <span class="bold">Demon.</span></p>
                <p>
                  Now, what on this planet earth is a Sleep Paralysis Demon?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before science could explain this phenomenon, sleep paralysis
                  was considered to be a demonic possession, since it feels like
                  a heavy force is pinning you down, or the “demon” is stepping
                  on you. Along with all of this, there plays a major factor in
                  people to this day believing there is an actual demon. In many
                  cases, people have seen a silhouette in front of them,
                  shuffling towards them. I personally, in my numerous episodes
                  have experienced that as well, and I can say this much- it
                  feels like you’re running out of breath in addition to the
                  loss of voice and mobility. So the best thing one can do, or
                  what has helped me the most, is to just shut my eyes tightly.
                  To make things a little less scary, here are a few scientific
                  reasons for why this may occur:
                  <br />
                  • Sleep deprivation. This is one of the main reasons for this
                  occurrence, but it’s different for each individual.
                  <br />
                  • Chronic sleeping disorders like narcolepsy.
                  <br />
                  • Anxiety disorder
                  <br />
                  • Post traumatic stress disorder
                  <br />
                  • Hypertension
                  <br />
                  • Clinical depression
                  <br />
                  • Family history of sleep paralysis<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what causes the illusion of seeing a figure shuffling
                  towards you? Is it paranormal? Not quite!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer is simple- sleep paralysis occurs when you are
                  having your REM (rapid eye movement) cycle. This is when you
                  have the most intense dreams since your brain is comparatively
                  active and your sleep is not that deep, hence what you see
                  feels life-like but is actually, all just in your mind, it’s
                  like a dream. So to put it in simple terms, your brain is
                  basically confused about whether or not you’re asleep and it
                  temporarily stops your movement to prevent you from acting out
                  physically to fight the figure you see in your dream, because
                  I can already imagine, that would be a complete disaster it it
                  weren’t for your temporarily paralyzed body. Even though there
                  is so much information available on this subject recently, in
                  spite of that, people are frightened to experience such an
                  occurrence, no matter how many times they’ve had it in the
                  past. Each episode feels like the first one which leads to
                  severe anxiety. The cultural beliefs surrounding this topic do
                  not make it any better and spew more fear. Yes, you are saved
                  from the physiological damage when it comes to having your
                  body temporarily paralyzed in the middle of the night,
                  however, the long term psychological impact is immensely
                  adverse. If you experience this at all, let alone frequently,
                  approach someone. A parent, a friend and guardian, a relative,
                  whoever. Know that you are not alone and do not hesitate to
                  ask for professional help as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sleep paralysis, as of now, has no cure, so the best you can
                  do is be aware of what you are experiencing and not feed
                  yourself or others with incorrect information. It will only
                  frighten you more. So here’s what I do after almost four years
                  of experiencing it now. Research, use logic and talk about it.
                  Will it decrease the number of episodes? No, but at least
                  you’ll know what’s happening and not think it is something so
                  absurd that you’d be considered weird for experiencing it and
                  for heaven’s sake, not believe an actual demon is using your
                  body as a dance floor!

                    I’m Vaishali, my pronouns are she/her and well, to say
                    something about myself, I am the sort of person who tries
                    out anything and everything. Some things turned out to be a
                    complete disaster, like sports, while some worked out very
                    well and I enjoy those things thoroughly. Singing, public
                    speaking, theatre and art are a few of them. Apart from that
                    very professional aspect of my introduction, I love meeting
                    new people and I absolutely adore dogs (because,
                    contradicting my own statement about people, dogs are better
                    any day.)
