                <p>
                  COP26 was this year’s momentous UN Climate Change Conference at Glasgow, 
                  Scotland from the 31st October until November 12th. The term ‘COP’ stands for 
                  “conference of the parties”, which is a submit therein 197 signatories come 
                  forward to discuss matters on how to implement the treaty in order to tackle
                   global warming alongside other effects of the same. COP started back in 1995 
                   for advancement of climate actions and commitments, and to talk about the 
                   crown jewel event of this submit, it was The Paris Agreement in 2015 which 
                   provides us with structure of annual COP negotiations, however it can be 
                   said that the commitments of such submit, now doesn’t seem to help us in levels it should.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With climate change rising on the top agenda on a global platform, we find that very 
                  less people are aware that the <span class="bold">Emissions Gap Report 2021</span> released in October reveals 
                  that the ongoing pledges to reduce greenhouse emissions and the cord on global warming 
                  still puts the world on track to warm by <span class="bold">2.7 degrees Celsius</span>, which would be devastating 
                  for millions of defenceless people and put communities at risk. The IPCC report released 
                  earlier this year clearly states the devastating impacts on the planet for a temperature 
                  increase exceeding pre-industrial levels by <span class="bold">1.5 degrees Celsius. In a situation wherein, 
                  if the temperature exceeds pre-industrial levels beyond 2 degrees, extreme heat waves 
                  would occur every 3.5 years instead of a general 50 years leading to uninhabitable living 
                  conditions in certain areas and an increase in wildfires alongside wide-spreading droughts.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Nationally Determined Contributions, under the UNs Convention on Climate Change is where countries decide and put forth their actions to mitigate climate change first decided in the Paris Agreement and the countries were required to update them in 2020, which India is yet to do so. However India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s five point agenda can be considered as a verbal updating but the official submission is still due which could be seen as a product to help bring more clarity to these agendas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He promised us,<br /><span class="bold">
                  1. An increase in its renewable energy capacity i.e. to 500 GW
                  by 2030.<br />
                  2. Fulfil 50% of its energy requirement through renewable
                  energy by 2030.<br />
                  3. Cut down its projected carbon emission by 1 billion tonnes
                  by 2030.<br />
                  4. Bring down the carbon intensity of the economy by more than
                  45% by 2030.<br />
                  5. And finally achieve the target of net zero carbon emissions
                  by 2070.<br /></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  He also asked the developed nations to make $1 trillion available for climate finance and 
                  proposed a one word movement called LIFE which means Life Style for Environment. His 
                  promises have been called high ambitions and brought us to think about a question 
                  <span class="bold">“How are we going to 50% renewable energy by 2030 with our love for coal” </span>as put forth by another climate activist Disha Ravi. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  India being the world’s third largest emitter with a previous record of 2.88 billion tonnes last year, the net-zero targets seems like a big challenge and it means we have to phase out coal which again is fuelling 70% of our electricity, which surprisingly did not find its mention in the Prime Minister’s speech. To achieve this we have to switch to electric vehicles and decarbonise polluting industries, creation of forest (another important which did not find a direct mention in his speech), and installation of more solar power plants all in the next few decades to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We find that Indian activists like Vinisha Umashankar delivered quite 
                  thought-provoking speeches at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference; 
                  they urged world leaders to “stop talking and start doing” which is 
                  nothing if not the truth. She voiced sentimental wishes representing 
                  several activists saying <span class="bold">“my generation will have to see the consequences of your action today” </span>and further adding “you are deciding whether or not we’ve a chance to live in a habitable world. You are deciding whether we are worth fighting for; worth supporting and worth caring”, this moved several listeners, and me if not you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The world famous Greta Thunberg called the climate summit a <span class="bold">“failure”</span> and a <span class="bold">“PR exercise”</span>,  and it does beg the question for what are the current year targets, because from where we are standing right now we need targets exercised and plans set for every month, every year to save the world from burning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is very essential to understand that climate problem is not a technological or ecological problem, <span class="bold">it’s a political problem</span>; because we have seen it over the years that the political groups are so driven towards getting re-elected that they follow corruptive methods, prioritise interest groups and some short term interest because an investment in climate change will not give them the instant credit they required to influence voters as benefits come later for such investments. We need leaders to put aside their self-interests but given the characteristics of human nature it seems like an unrealistic demand but at the same time it is something that could solve the climate problems for those who had no hand in creating them in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, going back to COP26, this ended with countries adopting a new global climate deal, 
                  which pressed for urgent emission cuts and ambitious money promised for developing nations- 
                  to help customize to climate impacts. Several developing countries were frustrated because 
                  their concerns were left unaddressed, these concerns were specifically referred to the massive 
                  destruction caused by extremities in weather, now hitting harder than previously predicted. 
                  Earlier the deal included a commitment to <span class="bold">“phase out coal”</span> but was edited to <span class="bold">“coal phase down”</span> after attempts by India and China, which were supported by Africa and Iran and Nigeria on fossil fuels subsidies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore it could be said that Glasgow failed most important pledges i.e. to protect forests, phase out coal and reduce subsidies.

                    Hi, I’m Dipali Banka (she/her)- a proud feminist, a heterosexual and an aspiring journalist. My love for books started when I picked up my first Harry Potter and now I’m reading more of the political genre. I love to volunteer for social causes at NGOs and I adore Taylor Swift and Sylvia Plath because they help me understand my emotions.
