                <p>
                    Vladimir Nabokov’s <span class="italic"> Lolita </span> is a markedly distinct book. It 
                    has gone down in history as one of the 20th century’s best 
                    pieces of literary fiction, made into a 1962 film by stalwart 
                    director Stanley Kubrick, and has timelessly embedded itself 
                    in social dialogue and popular culture (no matter how lucid or 
                    hopelessly broken from the original that culture is). It is, in 
                    technical terms, a peculiarity of form. The book is essentially 
                    a book within a book. The author suggests that the book within 
                    the book is all that is. The writer of this book-within-the-book 
                    is European literary scholar and widower Humbert Humbert. He is 
                    also the perpetrator of the tale, the abuser of Lolita.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Much of Lolita’s prose engages the reader to this man. And reading about Lolita’s rape through his perspective lens, jumping into a world of his making and thinking, can be a difficult experience. It can also be angering, and it most certainly is repelling, at times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it is also telling. Nabokov’s protagonist is not a doofus, he’s undeniably smart. Not only is he clever - you’d expect that from any worthwhile anti-hero – he is self-aware, disciplined (in almost all the important ways.) 10 pages into the book, and this will be confirmed. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is why, as we delve into deeper layers, a primary reason for our intrigue with Lolita surfaces: Vladimir Nabokov takes a backseat as all authorial confidence is given to a fictitious being. This fictitious being invites you into a self-indulgent inner monologue, showing you a case of three interloping phenomena: namely, people, space and time. The intricacies of these terms, in context, should be clear by the end of the article.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, to explore the book, I have decided to pick one small entry out of the mix and unfold it in terms of what it tells us about the story. It does not contain any information critical to the narrative (only a few diary entries do) but to repeat the word, it is telling. Note that this won’t be so expansive as to cover everything you need to understand about the book. There are many intricacies, stories, places, allusions, behaviorisms, interactions, thoughts scattered in a perfect harmony throughout Nabokov’s lush prose. This is just a very minutely detailed glimpse that extrapolates the winds surfacing Lolita’s style. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Context: Around 200 pages into the story, Humbert and Lolita are living in Beardsley, Pennsylvania after a year-long 27000-mile road trip across the country. Lolita has been enrolled in an auspicious Beardsley College For Women that prides itself on its modernity through the design of a close-knit programme comprising ‘the four D’s – Dramatics, Dance, Debating and Dating’. Humbert is characteristically skeptical, albeit happily resigned, happy to settle obscured in a remote place with Lolita. Lolita has made friends at the school, fitting in, despite the qualms associated with her troubled personal life. But she’s academically faltering and stepfather Humbert is invited to have a talk with Mrs. Pratt, headmistress of the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="italic">One Monday afternoon, in December I think, Pratt asked me to come over for a talk. Dolly’s last report had been poor, I knew. But instead of contenting myself with some such plausible explanation of this summons, I imagined all sorts of horrors, and had to fortify myself with a pint of my ‘pin’ before I could face the interview. Slowly, all Adam’s apple and heart, I went up the steps of the scaffold.
                    </span>
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Look at the directness of Humbert’s words, the ease with which he presents himself. “I imagined all sorts of horrors” makes him seem helpless to us, while “all Adam’s apple and heart” banishes those thoughts with indications of a hidden satire in the build-up to a fateful interaction (Humbert’s omniscient wit yet playing with us.)

                </p>

                <p><span class="italic">
                    A huge woman, gray-haired, frowsy, with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind black-rimmed glasses – “Sit down,” she said, pointing to an informal and humiliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair. 
                   </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Humbert has a distaste for the adult (viewing him as boring, excessively indulgent, and emotional), even one of the opposite sex. He often describes attractive women with all their desirable features, outlining the shape of their face, the shade of their skin, the curves on their body; then immediately going ‘Bah!’ and finding a behaviorism that renders the person described a dull, passable stereotype. It reeks of skeptical wisdom and is, in truth, very convincing. He describes Mrs. Pratt as ‘a huge woman, gray-haired, frowsy, with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind black-rimmed glasses’. This creates in our minds an image of a pointy lady, pristine with her mannerisms and standards (about to school Humbert, additionally.) That deceptive current of skeptical meticulousness runs throughout Lolita, not only providing comic relief, but, in-fact, a major ingredient to the substance of the book. We addictively read a pedophile's cruelly accurate biographies of those around (and with) him more than we usually engage with the conventional beats of a book, in this book.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Second, when Pratt asks Humbert to sit down on ‘an informal and humiliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair.’ Nabokov, or may I say, Humbert, creates an indicative dynamic here. Humbert, afraid that he would be caught out for his deplorable misdeeds, heightens his satire at the prospect of his own fear. Obviously, this is amazing writing. But that’s not what is essential here. Remember, Nabokov is writing what Humbert is writing. This means Humbert creates the dynamic, not Nabokov (for all fictitious purposes). What does this imply? It implies knowledge, on Humbert’s part, not only of the fact that people are after him but also who exactly they may be. 

                </p>

                <p><span class="italic">
                    “Let me ask a blunt question, Mr. Haze. You are an old-fashioned Continental father, aren’t you?”<br>
                    “Why, no,” I said, “conservative, perhaps, but not what you would call old-fashioned.”

                   </span>
                </p>

                <p>This is irony at its best. Humbert is far from a father in all respects. He is a monster, an animal to Lolita. And he enjoys this security that comes with being her quasi-legal guardian.
                    <br>Then, talking about Lolita’s conduct: 
                    </p>

                    <p><span class="italic">
                        Now comes the last week in November. Sighs a good deal in class. Does not bite her nails, though if she did, this would conform better to her general pattern – scientifically speaking, of course. Menstruation, according to the subject, well established…..Giggles rather often. A little dreamy. Has private jokes of her own, transposing for instance the first letters of some of her teacher’s names. Hair light and dark brown, lustrous – well [laughing] you are aware of that, I suppose. 
    
                       </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When one reads these lines, one imagines a coherent identity: a playful teen girl, somewhat of a tomboy, goofing around in school and scribbling traces of a made-up language on her small wooden desk. But there’s more to it than that. Both Pratt and Humbert know this, and brace themselves for an all-out war hidden under the subtext of their formal exchange. 

                    </p>
                    <p><span class="italic">
                        Miss Gold says Dolly’s tennis form is excellent to superb, even better than Linda Hall’s, but concentration and point-accumulation are just “poor to fair.” Miss Cormorant cannot decide whether Dolly has exceptional emotional control or none at all. Miss Horn reports she – I mean, Dolly – cannot verbalize her emotions, while according to Miss Cole Dolly’s metabolic efficiency is superfine.

    
                       </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note how the talk about her tennis form is completely irrelevant to the exchange here. So is the transition from the subject of her emotional incapacity to her “metabolic efficiency.” When Pratt does get to the point, it’s something all readers anticipated. 

                    </p>

                    <p><span class="italic">
                        The general impression is that fifteen year-old Dolly remains morbidly uninterested in sexual matters, or to be exact, represses her curiosity in order to save her ignorance and self-dignity. 

                       </span>
                    </p>

                    <p>Now, Lolita has been subject to many interpretations from many different schools of thought. Two of those are the Freudian and the Feminist School. The Freudian analysis revolves around the consequences of characters’ significant life-events: more specifically, the role of external conflict as crystallization of subconscious internal conflict. These interpretations focus on the backgrounds, relations and behaviourisms of subject characters as keys to identity and understanding. It’s basic literary analysis. Pratt seems to be talking about Freudian interpretations of Lolita’s behaviorisms her schoolteachers have made, herself. The fact that Nabokov hated Freudian analysis (calling it voodooism) of his literature is definitive. Despising and dispelling it, much of Lolita admittedly, according to him, makes an argument against simplicity and reductionism in the treatment of art. Humbert, as if Nabokov’s assistant in arrogance, acknowledges these burning attempts at his psychoanalysis  by claiming that he has plunged the ‘able psychiatrist’ into ‘a state of leporine fascination’.  
                    </p>

                    <p>The Feminist School bases its analysis on critical discussion of institutions in society and how they hinder personal and socio-economic development of marginalized groups, with the most prominent classification being sex. The institutional argument is indeed valid: much of Humbert Humbert’s prose involves the visual and physical abuse of Lolita with environmental ignorance in the narrative as a permissive medium. Much of this criticism can be directed against institutions of education, in this narrative and beyond. Beardsley College, while being posh and confident in its philosophies (and quite troubling with the stabs it takes at Humbert’s conscience), is also ultimately ignorant and helpless in offering Lolita the assistance she needs to claim a sort of identity for herself. Her framing, therefore, takes to roguish antidotes. The very nature of institutions, in this connotation and in Nabokov’s age, is that no matter how progressive they want their machinations to be, predators will persist and so will the predated. 
                    </p>

                    <p>This is the scene where the most important critical aspects of Lolita’s text and subtext intersect, in my opinion. Namely, they are the H.H. mind’s eye, the various schools of thought that extrapolate their interpretations from Nabokov’s rich text, and the suspense a criminal experiences when confronted by an emancipator. 
                    </p>

                    <p>No matter what is said by unconventional critics who claim that all books must be read with disregard for solid ethical codes in literature, Lolita is a haunting work on sexual abuse and the institutions which facilitate this. In prominence, it’s about the relationship between an abuser and his stepdaughter. But far too often, in Humbert’s captivating helplessness and the loud voices of readily acknowledged truth, we forget that Lolita is also about Lolita. It’s about Dolly Haze, or Dolly Humbert, or Dolly Schiller, and her life’s journey through these names etched "onto dotted lines. 
                    </p>

                    <p>That being said, there are parts of Lolita that, like any other pure work of art, cannot be explained through words (much to the disappointment of the Socratic Ideal) or interpreted through ideology. This is the soul of the book: the character of Lolita, who we know to be ignored by Humbert in his wild jerks of perversion and indulgence (so much so that we are ready to blame Nabokov for her aesthetic mistreatment.) 
                    </p>

                    <p>There are select instances when we see a fleeting shadow of Lolita through the corners of our eyes. She seems to be a fact blended into a myth by debauchery and distortion, cloaked from us all, yet enduring and true. A youthful soul, tamed and controlled, in wasteful and pure ignorance. A product of growth and decay in her space and time, eternal in our minds. These are the times when the author gives way to what he knows and therefore, understands: people. The inherent point in Lolita is, ultimately, the major purpose of art - painting lives of those who don’t exist but are the realest versions of us and the people around us. That’s why Lolita lives on.
                    </p>

                        And it struck me, as my automaton knees went up and down, that I simply did not know a thing about my darling’s mind, and that quite possibly, behind the awful juvenile clichés, there was in her a garden and a twilight, and a palace gate – dim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me, in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions.
