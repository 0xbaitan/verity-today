                    15th November which would be an ordinary day for most people, was certainly not same for actor-comedian Vir Das. His monologue “I come from two Indias” premiered on YouTube; in addition to that it was posted on his Instagram account. It was a six minute clip from his performance at the Kennedy Centre in Washington DC on 13th November focusing on the contrasting situation, mind-set he discovers in India. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    It is somewhat predictable that if any individual other that of a right wing would be facing major backslash from the its citizens where prominent cricketers and actors believe that farmer’s protest is the country’s private matter and not open for international opinions for expressing anything which is scripted in favour of the party in power. Vir Das faced the predicted and many parts of his satire where up for controversies all over India, especially “I come from an India where we worship women during the day and gang-rape them during the night”.

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not news that a certain group of the society faces violence executed by men, according to data by the National Commission for Women the country recorded a 46% of rise in complaints of crimes eight months into this year against women and we also have to acknowledge the fact that a higher percentage goes unreported; the last data was made available in 2018 by National Family Health Survey of a survey conducted in 2015-16 was 99.1% of sexual violence goes unreported. During a religious ceremony, in the religious texts a great deal of importance is given to women, the wife sits with her husband in a hindu family during ceremonial practices, we call the women ‘’laxmi” and yet we fail to provide them safety and guarantee that men can keep it in their pants and understand the meaning of a “yes” and a “no”. However it is not surprising that we find a majority is only concerned in proving that they don’t rape and provide the bare minimum with an expectation of receiving an award for such acts of humanity basics along with being dismissive simultaneously, given that a #notallmen has never failed to make appearance when individuals talk about violence against women.

                    What Vir Das did was merely touching upon certain concerning situations- the love hate relationship with our neighbour country, gang rape, prices of petrol, ethical practice of press and the treatment of spectrum. But it is kind of a deeply rooted habit we have been inculcated within, i.e. making mountain of a molehill and that is exactly what happened. On one hand we have congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi saying “Generalising the evils of a few individuals and vilifying the nation as a whole in front of the world is just not done! The people who painted India in front of the west as a nation of saperas and luteras during the colonial rule have not ceased to exist” in his tweet we have Shashi Tharoor saying Vir Das “knows the real meaning of “standup”is not physical but moral”. Can we ever have a controversial topic in motion and Kangana Ranaut?, “When you generalise all Indian men as gang-rapists it gives rise and encouragement to racism and bullying against Indians all over the world... after Bengal Famine Churchill famously said, ‘These Indians breed like rabbits they are bound to die like this...’ he blamed Indians’ sex drive/fertility for the death of millions because of hunger... Such creative work targeting an entire race is soft terrorism... strict actions must be taken against such criminals @virdas” is what she wrote and it is very much recommended to move ahead as we cannot really put words to our thoughts on her take. We also see Taapse Pannu coming forward with an optimistic approach, “I also come from the India who believes we shall get through this time too.”

                    It is very much possible for a piece of work to be criticised, every artist looks forward to some constructive criticism and look forward to improve because at the end of the we all want to right the wrongs and grow, become better and achieve the best. However it is important to draw a fine line between being reasonable and trying to trash talk another person. However Vir Das later came forward after this emotional outburst in various spectres of social media and he tweeted, “There has been a sizeable reaction to a video I posted on YouTube. The video is a satire about the duality of two very separate India’s that do different things. Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret,” which in its all capacity the truth. Where there is good, there is bad and in order to achieve the best we have to acknowledge the bad and remember the good to not lose faith.

                    In an interview with India Today he said, “If you find my jokes funny, I appreciate you, if you don't find my jokes funny, I appreciate you. If you don't find my jokes funny, I hope you find something (else) so funny that you fall off your chair laughing” and in a good spirit we hope the same.

                    Hi, I’m Dipali Banka (she/her)- a proud feminist, a heterosexual and an aspiring journalist. My love for books started when I picked up my first Harry Potter and now I’m reading more of the political genre. I love to volunteer for social causes at NGOs and I adore Taylor Swift and Sylvia Plath because they help me understand my emotions.
