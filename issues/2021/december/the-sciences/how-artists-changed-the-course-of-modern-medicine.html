                  Anatomy is the study of the human body. The actual term
                  anatomy originates from the Greek verb “anatomein,” which
                  means “to cut open or to dissect”. It describes an important
                  process of opening up and dissecting the body into individual
                  parts and their function.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Anatomy is the oldest scientific field studied in medicine.
                  The first dissection performed on the human body and to have
                  been documented was carried out during the third century B.C.
                  in Alexandria. During that period, anatomists were exploring
                  anatomy through dissections of different animals, primarily
                  pigs and monkeys.
                  <br />
                  Claudius Galen (129-199) is a distinguished medical doctor in
                  Ancient Greece whose conclusions are in simple terms primarily
                  based totally on the examination of animals and whose
                  defective theories on human anatomy dominate and impact
                  scientific technology till the Renaissance, i.e. for over
                  1,000 years.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although anatomy isn't formally banned by the Church, social
                  government reject the dissection of human corpses till the
                  twelfth or even thirteenth century. This is why anatomical
                  studies stagnate. An alternate mindset toward the coaching
                  anatomy most effective occurs in the course of the thirteenth
                  and 14th centuries. However, teaching largely made up of of
                  lectures from the works of Galen—without verification via real
                  dissections.
                </p>

                <p>
                  15TH/16TH CENTURY Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), today`s
                  famous Renaissance artist and scientist, plays many anatomical
                  dissections of human corpses that shape the premise for his
                  famous, surprisingly distinctive anatomical sketches.
                </p>

                <p>
                  LEONARDO DA VINCI In medieval times, the frame is visible
                  because of the frail housing of the soul. During the
                  Renaissance, however, the human frame is exalted for its
                  beauty and will become the number one supply of proposal for
                  artists of this epoch. For the sake of art, many Renaissance
                  artists start analyzing the human frame.

                  Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo have the opportunity to
                  attend lectures and seminars taught by their medically skilled
                  friends, however alternatively choose up the scalpel
                  themselves – with the intention to demonstrate the frame in
                  all its herbal splendor. The two are widely known for their
                  representations of the frame and muscle tissues depicted
                  withinside the most realistic manner, however additionally the
                  bone structure, the skeleton and the skin. Leonardo da Vinci
                  passionately research the human frame. frequently, at night,
                  he climbs cemetery walls, steals bodies, and drags them into
                  his studio. There, he dissects them and makes use of them as
                  inspirations and guides for his sculptures.
                </p>

                <p>
                  FROM THE 16TH CENTURY ONWARDS The real study of anatomy is
                  based in the course of the Renaissance with the paintings of
                  anatomist and surgeon, Andreas Vesalius. Vesalius describes
                  what he observes in the course of the general dissection of
                  human corpses. By dissecting human bodies, getting the
                  descriptions of muscle tissues, tendons, and nerves right all
                  the way down to the smallest detail, Vesalius is capable of
                  showing greater than two hundred mistakes in Galen`s
                  anatomical works. With his complete clinical expertise and the
                  amount of research he has conducted on human bodies, the
                  younger professor of medicine revolutionized anatomy, however
                  consequently, also changed the course of modern medicine and
                  what is taught in medical schools
                </p>

                <p>
                  17TH CENTURY Artistic passion evokes the anatomists of the
                  Renaissance, and the the general interest of the masses in
                  anatomy grows. More and greater, physicians, in addition to
                  the overall public, need to look the human frame with their
                  very own eyes. The word “autopsy” originated from the Greek
                  phrase, “To see with one`s very own eyes”. Anatomical theatres
                  are constructed in lots of cities. Rich and poor alike could
                  visit the general public dissection viewings.
                </p>

                <p>
                  18TH CENTURY Some anatomists use their dissection talents in a
                  historically creative manner and render their specimens into
                  works of art that can withstand the tests of time. Honoré
                  Fragonard renders his anatomical specimens into lasting
                  portions of art. He injects them with coloured wax that
                  hardens in the blood vessels. The closing tissues dries up and
                  is handled with varnish. His works are nevertheless on show on
                  the Ecole Nationale Vétérinaire d`Alfort close to Paris,
                  France. In the 18th century, anatomical artists create the
                  primary frames of the specimens, which they can then can dry
                  and varnish to their liking. Some specimens from that point
                  include metallic alloys which can be melted and injected into
                  the arteries.
                </p>

                <p>
                  19TH/20TH CENTURY After the standards of human macroscopic
                  anatomy—they examine dissected organs—and this established
                  practice helped catapult the knowledge we have gained about
                  how our body works by introducing new techniques and theories
                  which not only make studying the human anatomy more
                  interesting but more scholarly too. The area of anatomy will
                  become specialized. The public hobby in anatomy does now no
                  longer wane for numerous centuries. It wont be till the
                  nineteenth century, that the viewings of anatomy dissections
                  will no longer be accessible to the public.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It was not till Human anatomy became a regulated and mandatory
                  course in all medical schools that people truly understood why
                  we needed to know about how our body works. There is a mass of
                  misinformation out there regarding our bodies and their inner
                  workings which can be dangerous but with the correct knowledge
                  and resources we can cure diseases and help our bodies become
                  more efficient when it comes to physical activities such as
                  exercise or manual labour.

                    Hi! I'm Tiya. I am an 11th grader in Calcutta International
                    School. I love all things Science and medicine, and
                    literature. Honestly, I could stay up for hours on end just
                    reading and researching. I joined Verity Today in hopes to
                    help others develop an interest in STEM and step out of my
                    comfort zone and learn new things.
