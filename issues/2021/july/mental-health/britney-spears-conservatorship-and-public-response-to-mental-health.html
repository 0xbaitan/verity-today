                  Pop culture fiends and gossip pages have been rife with news
                  over the past two years surrounding Britney Spears, and her
                  controversial conservatorship. It has even sparked several
                  documentaries and an online movement entitled #FreeBritney.
                  Even if the situation has been exploited by tabloids and the
                  paparazzi for clickbait and easy money, it presents an insight
                  into longstanding issues regarding mental health within the
                  larger world, both in jurisdiction and legality, as well as in
                  public opinion.

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some

                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has

                  Before discussing Spears herself, it is necessary to
                  understand what conservatorship is. According to the Judicial
                  Branch of California, a conservatorship is “a court case where
                  a judge appoints a responsible person or organization (called
                  the ‘conservator’) to care for another adult (called the
                  ‘conservatee’) who cannot care for himself or herself or
                  manage his or her finances.” This is in the interest of people
                  suffering from mental illnesses or for those who require
                  old-age support. Such guardianship was also the subject of the
                  Golden Globe-winning: ‘I Care A Lot’ (2020), starring Rosamund
                  Pike.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After her initial success, Britney came under great public
                  attack in the 2000s, a phenomenon that seems to be an unfair
                  rite of passage for most female pop stars after they break
                  into mainstream attention. With constant slut-shaming and
                  criticism from the press following her breakup with Justin
                  Timberlake and hypersexualised image in most music videos,
                  things came to a head in 2007, during her divorce with husband
                  Kevin Federline when she lost custody to both her children.
                  Relentless surveillance by the paparazzi had only catalysed an
                  already difficult period of her life, leading to several
                  nervous breakdowns, including the infamous incident when
                  Spears shaved her head bald. In light of these mental health
                  concerns and numerous visits to rehabilitation facilities,
                  Jamie Spears, her father, was granted conservatory rights over
                  her financial assets (as a financial conservator) and herself
                  as a person (as a personal conservator).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Initially, this seemed to be a wise and respectable move, as
                  Spears was in a genuine need of help. However, the past few
                  years have aroused suspicions with regards to the
                  effectiveness of a continued guardianship. In 2019, Jamie
                  Spears stepped down from his role as personal conservator due
                  to “health issues”, and Jodi Montgomery was appointed as a
                  temporary replacement. Since then, Britney’s lawyers have
                  issued numerous statements, declaring that she was “afraid of
                  her father”, and that she would like Montgomery to be
                  appointed to this role permanently, and for her father to step
                  down. Unfortunately, this request was turned down by a Los
                  Angeles judge in early 2021, naming the financial firm the
                  Bessemer Trust a co-conservator of her estate instead. Jamie
                  Spears’ conservator powers have also been extended to
                  September 2021. As of now, news has emerged that Britney
                  herself has requested to address the court regarding her
                  conservatorship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Spears case is only one of the millions around the
                  world, it has done well to shed light on a phenomenon that was
                  rarely heard about by the general public. Both parties have
                  vigorously contested each other’s claims: Jamie maintains that
                  Britney’s unhappiness in the conservatorship are mere
                  “conspiracy theories”, while her lawyers insist that she is
                  unable to speak out herself on account of her father’s
                  suppression. Neither side has been verified yet, but the fact
                  that such an atrocity is even plausible speaks volumes about
                  the mental health infrastructure that is prevalent within the
                  legislations of many nations. Such laws prioritise the voice
                  of the guardian over that of an actual ailing subject who is
                  unable to voice their grievances without fear. The framework
                  institutionalised is clearly inadequate when there is no
                  adequate system in place to review a judgement that was passed
                  more than a decade ago which concerns a person’s health.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The media response to the situation has also been telling,
                  with the paparazzi frenzy echoing that of the 2000s which led
                  to Britney’s initial breakdown. Spears herself has spoken
                  about the numerous documentaries being made about her life, in
                  an Instagram post: "So many documentaries about me this year
                  with other people's takes on my life. These documentaries are
                  so hypocritical… they criticize the media and then do the same
                  thing? Damn…”. It is evident that mental health always has and
                  continues to be trivialised by mainstream media. Urgent reform
                  is required, both in the institutions that have been
                  established to deal with mental illness on a legal basis, as
                  well as the public approach to such sensitive issues that are
                  instead sensationalised by the media circus.
