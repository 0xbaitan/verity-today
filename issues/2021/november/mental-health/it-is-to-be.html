                  “They were meant to be successful; it was written in the
                  stars.” It most likely was not. It was probably written on
                  exam sheets and a lot of those had triple-digit scores which
                  was probably the result of years of perseverance to finally
                  reach the pearly gates to success. In fact, there was probably
                  no help whatsoever from cosmic forces that helped them achieve
                  their goal. So much so that said cosmic forces were probably
                  working against them, in the form of student loans, cynicism,
                  anxiety and the historically ubiquitous self-doubt.

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some

                    on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials
                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has

                  Paulo Coehlo says that even when we are facing adversity, the
                  universe conspires to help us reach our destiny- whatever that
                  may be. As much as I bask in the genius in his folklore, a
                  single thought persisted throughout my journey of reading The
                  Alchemist. It is only towards the end that we realise that his
                  destiny was to persevere and the reward was waiting for him.
                  Destiny only exists in retrospect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Putting myself in his shoes, I could barely see myself letting
                  go of my livelihood with a sure hand of success, let alone
                  trust the words of a stranger I had met ten minutes ago just
                  so that I could achieve a destiny I knew nothing of. Or even
                  if it existed. What if Santiago had just chosen to stay at the
                  crystal merchant’s shop a little longer so that he could make
                  a little more money? He would have never reached the caravans.
                  The war in the desert would have reduced the oasis to ruble.
                  No other caravan would have traversed that land for months. He
                  would never have met the Alchemist or reached the pyramid or
                  found out that the treasure was back home all along and that
                  his real destiny was learning all he had during the journey.
                  It would have made for just another story about yet another
                  person who never got to fulfil their destiny.

                  The general cynicism and anxiety that courses through the
                  veins of humanity will more times than not, keep us rooted in
                  our comfort zones. Necessity would keep the best of people
                  from risking it all for something that could be. And the
                  belief that we are all destined for one thing comes with an
                  enormous wave of reasonable doubt that stains everything we
                  do. Every action, every decision will be watermarked with
                  self-doubt.

                  The term "fatalism" can refer to the view according to which
                  human beings are powerless to do anything other than what they
                  actually do, closely intertwined with the belief that humans
                  have no power to influence the future or indeed the outcome of
                  their own actions. We like to believe that we have the power
                  to decide what our future is. We fight for free will, for the
                  ability to make decisions without the hindrance of what other
                  people opine. Humanity’s long fight for that basic right gets
                  nullified by the belief that we have one purpose and one
                  destiny alone and that that should be what we work towards. It
                  takes you down a spiral of hopelessness and anxiety and
                  eventually, intensifies to the point where it affects the
                  functioning of our day and our response to the world around
                  us. It is an added anxiety. Every time a child is told at an
                  early age that they are destined to pursue one career without
                  even considering the changes they might go through over the
                  course of eighteen years adds another barrier between them and
                  what they truly want. Eventually, they see what is put in
                  front of them as the predetermined choice and they go with it
                  because ‘that is what you were always meant to be’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to the National Library of Medicine, fatalism is
                  correlated with depression and the weakening of locus of
                  control. Locus of Control refers to an individual's perception
                  of the underlying main causes of events in their life. A group
                  of participants were recruited who completed self-evaluation
                  scales measuring depression symptoms, classic fatalism, active
                  fatalism, coping skills, and locus of control. It was found
                  that while classic fatalism was significantly and positively
                  associated with depression and negative coping, active
                  fatalism was positively correlated with positive coping
                  skills, and negatively correlated with depression and external
                  locus of control. Finally, the study found that active
                  fatalism impacted a gradient in both depression and anxiety
                  symptoms, regardless of whether it is influenced by classic
                  fatalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Active fatalism is the belief in a predetermined future,
                  combined with the belief that one must do their part to bring
                  this predestined future into reality. The helplessness towards
                  one’s own life becomes an active participant in our emotions
                  instead of just being a unitary belief or something that
                  people say to comfort themselves when the people they want to
                  end up together in a movie are going through a rough patch. It
                  leads to a sense of resignation from one’s life as soon as a
                  certain action or decision yields a negative result. The
                  general opinion is that that is where the breadcrumb trail
                  disappears and their destiny is lost. Or the belief gets
                  twisted into them believing that their destiny was to fail and
                  whatever adversity happened was going to happen regardless of
                  whatever choice they made. That is a sadness that forms around
                  you like a night terror- something you never see a way out of.
                  You start walking on eggshells around yourself because the
                  slightest thing could set it off. The slightest chink could
                  take your one purpose away from you, a purpose you didn’t
                  decide to be yours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nothing that happens is star crossed before it happens. It
                  happens, following which it is etched into the stars. We have
                  too much to offer to the world to let it be painted over with
                  the numbness of a purpose we did not decide. Romeo and Juliet
                  weren’t destined to die, they chose to. They could have just
                  as easily done one thing differently and they would have
                  lived, maybe not together but alive. Louisa May Alcott defied
                  everyone’s cries about Jo and Laurie being destined to be
                  together because she alone saw the potential Jo had as a
                  writer and explorer. As someone who would pen down the rich
                  life she had. As someone who would give children all over the
                  world a timeless faith in love and friendship.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We need to know to accept that when something good happens, we
                  have worked for it. It was not placed on a silver platter. But
                  as humans, we also have to accept responsibility for the
                  mistakes we make and fix them instead of submitting to a
                  hopeless reverie because the fault, dear Brutus is not in the
                  stars, but in ourselves.

                    atrociously tangled earphones, or reading either Emily
                    Dickinson or John Green to calm down because Emily and Edgar
                    scared me. I sometimes switch on the AC and listen to the
