                  The above lines have been taken from the famous poem ‘Bol’,
                  written by Urdu poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz. In keeping with Faiz’s
                  image as a poet of the revolution, the poem urges people to
                  speak out against tyranny and injustice with whatever they
                  have, a universal message of freedom of expression which goes
                  far beyond the boundaries of India and Pakistan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faiz is one of the most popular modern poets of the 20th
                  century whose work is widely read in both India and Pakistan
                  even today. That is because almost everything Faiz wrote about
                  his own times is still relevant in India's current political
                  climate. Poems that were written pre-Partition, at the peak of
                  India's independence movement, or post-Partition, as a new
                  country was taking shape, remain relevant seventy-four years
                  after Independence. Poems about standing up against tyranny,
                  speaking out against oppression, and raising our voices
                  against brutality, resonate with us because the seeds of
                  intolerance, fear and communal violence, that the makers of
                  independent India wanted to expunge from the country, still
                  breed and scour our land even today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Faiz Ahmad Faiz was born in Sialkot, a region of Punjab that
                  sits along the fault line of Partition, in 1911, in British
                  India. He went on to study at Government College and Oriental
                  College and was trained in the classical Persian poets Rumi
                  and Hafiz. Faiz is very popularly known as a Marxist and a
                  Leftist poet and won the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. In the
                  1930s, he became one of the protagonists of the anti-fascist,
                  pro-socialist Progressive Writers’ Movement and a few years
                  later, he became one of the founders of the Progressive
                  Writers’ Association. He served in the British Army during the
                  Second World War but soon resigned from the army and after
                  India and Pakistan gained independence in 1947, Faiz moved to
                  Lahore and became the editor of the Leftist English daily,
                  Pakistan Times. After India’s hasty partition by the British
                  in 1947, Faiz documented the country in the throes of
                  uncertainty, communal tension and horrific violence. He was
                  arrested in 1951 for the Rawalpindi conspiracy case and in
                  1955 on charges of conspiring to overthrow the government.
                  Today, he has achieved an archetypal legacy, not just for his
                  widely acclaimed love poems but also as a revolutionary poet
                  for his poems about the protest against oppression.

                  — ‘Hum Dekhenge’, Faiz Ahmad Faiz
                </p>
                <p>
                  When one thinks about Faiz’s most relevant poems today, the
                  first one to be thought of is ‘Hum Dekhenge’. The poem was
                  initially written in 1979 as a protest against the rising
                  Islamisation of Pakistan under General Zia-ul-Haq, the sixth
                  President of Pakistan but recently, the poem has become very
                  popular in India as it was used during the protests against
                  the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register
                  of Citizens (NRC). When the song was sung during such a
                  protest at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, a
                  professor raised objections about the poem being ‘anti-Hindu’.
                  Ironically, the very paragraph that the professor raised
                  objection to was the same one that was banned by the extremely
                  right-wing Zia regime for quoting the Quran. The poem is one
                  of Faiz’s most popular revolutionary poems today, in both
                  India and Pakistan, and continues to call out extremism in
                  both countries.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Bury me, oh my country, under your pavements, <br />
                  Where no man now dare walk with head held high, <br />
                  Where your true lovers bringing you their homage<br />
                  Must go in furtive fear of life or limb:<br />
                  For new-style law and order are in use,<br />
                  Good men learn, — ‘Stones locked up, and dogs turned
                  loose’.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  The above lines of the first stanza of ‘Nisar Main Teri
                  Galiyon Ke’ talks about the true lovers of the country, the
                  real patriots and activists who have to bow their heads in
                  fear of imprisonment and brutality when power falls in the
                  hands of those whose brutal propaganda becomes the law and
                  order of the country. Although this is another of Faiz’s poems
                  written against the Zia regime of Pakistan, we can see
                  reflections of such politics in our society today.
                  Unreasonable brutality towards those who raise their voice for
                  democracy, activists scared and silenced with terms like
                  ‘anti-nationalist’, and new legal systems introduced that
                  nurture intolerance and communalism. The poem talks about a
                  right-wing government that silenced and threatened and
                  frightened the masses to keep themselves in power.

                  Speak, say whatever is to be said. <br />

                  In the overall oeuvre of progressive poetry, Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s
                  contribution has often been considered paramount and ‘Bol’ is
                  one of his many poems which must be credited for this. The
                  poem adheres to Faiz’s politics and Marxist beliefs and was
                  initially written to address the labourers and the downtrodden
                  in society. But the poem not only has a universal appeal, its
                  lines also remain relevant even today. It encourages people to
                  stand up and speak out against injustice and totalitarianism
                  and will, therefore, remain relevant in every age and society
                  that attempts to stifle and silence the voices of its people.

                  During times of darkness and suppression, works of the
                  revolutionary poet not only speak of our discontents and
                  soothe our disquiet, but also awaken our complacency, bring us
                  together and move us to action against authoritarianism and
                  tyranny. Faiz Ahmad Faiz has been globally acclaimed as one of
                  the 20th century’s most progressive and relevant poets and his
                  work continues to respond to contemporary moments of crisis.
                  His work not only challenged structures of authority and power
                  and the failure of governments to respond to the situation of
                  the oppressed and the downtrodden, but it also introduced to
                  the masses the concept of revolutionary poetry and popularised
                  it, so much so that his poems are till date used as slogans of
                  protest against intolerance, brutality and discrimination. His
                  work continues to inspire generations to rise up and take
                  action against failing structures of authority, a movement as
                  necessary in India today as it was more than seventy-four
                  years ago.
