                  She clenched her fists. Embraced her present and changed her
                  future. That's what it took to crush a part of endless years
                  of patriarchy. Ironically, I don't read about her fierceness
                  in my textbooks; and I wonder why?

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some
                    people do not understand why you should have to spend money
                    on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials
                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has

                  "whispers are loud enough to be heard by the ones who want to
                  hear", Mrs Lini said; I remember it because it has carved my
                  memory. Listening to her anecdotes of women from the earlier
                  period, I was moved in the manner in which I could equate with
                  a narrative so different from my own life experience.

                  Under the shining stars of the midnight in the late seventeen
                  hundreds, as America persisted for its' freedom, Abigail Adams
                  wrote to her husband, "Remember the Ladies, and be more
                  generous and favourable to them than your ancestors." Years
                  later, we're finally able to exercise primary rights- voting,
                  driving, working in our professions and even getting an
                  education! Their forgotten lives hold many lessons for
                  present-day women. How did they defy the traditional belief
                  that women were unfit for education?

                  How did they persuade educational institutes to open their

                  <span class="bold">Marilyn Monroe:</span> Marilyn is a
                  remarkably celebrated modern-day feminist icon. Affirming her
                  feminine strength, Monroe ambitiously conquered a way out of
                  her constraints. Not once did she fail to promote herself and
                  boldly make her mark, even after almost seventy years after
                  her death, the marvellous star was back to invigorate me. She
                  was not afraid to talk about the sexual abuse she suffered
                  during her childhood and adulthoodâ€“a heavily censored subject
                  at the time, setting a bold, feminist example for women out
                  there!

                  <span class="bold">Anne Boelyn:</span> During the first
                  initial wave of feminism, Anne Boelyn was committed to the
                  betterment of women in various fields of literature. The
                  concept of equality between the various genders was very much
                  a subject of debate at the time- almost five centuries ago-
                  Boelyn was actively engaged in cultural debates regarding
                  female education. She was an advocate for literature, guarding
                  through the writings of modern writings by women. Anne often
                  argued about the contribution of women in the various fields,
                  evidencing several praiseworthy contributions to civilization,
                  and therefore should not be excluded from universities,
                  government, politics, employment and owning property.

                  <span class="bold"> Anandibai Joshi:</span> In the late
                  eighteen hundreds, a diminutive eighteen-year-old girl stood
                  up before an entirely male audience, seeking approval for an
                  unprecedented plan. Her presence by itself was worthy of
                  notice. The first female doctor of India, she stood firm,
                  keeping unwavering faith in herself as she challenged the
                  oppressive society. Out of everything she has created for
                  girls my age, formulating a massive career path whilst
                  battling colonialism and defamation- she also taught us that
                  faltering has never been equal to failing.

                  <span class="bold"> Aisha Taymur:</span> A rather underrated
                  author in the modern world, Aisha Taymur was a social activist
                  and an advocate for feminism. She raised her voice against the
                  deprivation of rights women had had to suffer through; Her
                  stories encouraged young girls to 'keep their head high even
                  through their uncountable self-doubts'. Rediscovering the
                  literature of the ancient world had inspired the humanist
                  learning of women's rights. Taymur spoke up for the education
                  of women and defended them from inequality, she was of vital
                  importance in shaping politics and culture and helped to
                  propagate new ideas.

                  As we evolve together, as a society- we must keep in mind to
                  remember the ladies, all of whom had massive contributions in
                  shaping the world that we live in today, making it better. And
                  as we share our gratitude to them, we must also extend our
                  gratitude to the ones who went unnoticed because our bravest
                  moments can sometimes be invisible.

                    I'm Vidushi. I'm sixteen, studying in 11th grade under the
                    CBSE board. My pronouns are she/her. In my free time, you
                    can find me reading, admiring sunsets, or watching anime. I
                    am passionate about STEM; I'd want to pursue a career in
                    Computer Science. Through many leadership experiences that
                    I've had-from hurdling around my school- I've learned to
                    appreciate human association, diversity, and the impact of
                    studentsâ€™ voices. My existence is also massively dependent
                    on blueberry cheesecakes.
