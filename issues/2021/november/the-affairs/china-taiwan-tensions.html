                <p>
                  Tensions between China and Taiwan have risen since China's
                  National Day on October 1st, which commemorates the founding
                  of the People's Republic of China (PRC). China flew nearly 100
                  fighter planes into Taiwan's air defence identification zone
                  during the 72nd anniversary festivities, jangling nerves in
                  Taiwan and raising fears throughout the globe that it was
                  preparing to occupy the island by force. Despite the fact that
                  it is mostly unrecognised by other nations, Taiwan considers
                  itself to be an independent country, and its officials,
                  notably President Tsai Ing-wen, have promised to protect its
                  sovereignty against China's objective of "reunification."
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Taiwan Strait is now one of the world's most dangerous
                  locations.The strait that divides the People's Republic of
                  China from Taiwan is known as "The Black Ditch" (officially
                  called the Republic of China). Although the names are
                  practically same, the two countries are vastly different: on
                  one side of the strait, there is an authoritarian, communist
                  government, and on the other, a democracy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  War between the "two Chinas" might enlist the help of
                  neighbouring nations as well as the US, making it the
                  deadliest conflict since World War II. To understand the
                  conflict, it firstly becomes imperative to understand the
                  origins.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The PRC has felt that Taiwan must be reunified with the
                  mainland since its foundation in 1949, whereas the RoC has
                  maintained its status as a "independent" country. During the
                  Cold War, the RoC led the non-communist opposition to China,
                  and until 1971, it was the only "China" recognised by the UN.
                  The US supported Taiwan's independence, maintained ties with
                  Taipei, and sold weapons to it it at the time, thanks to the
                  secret diplomacy of Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon's
                  national security adviser. The US endorses Taiwan's
                  independence, continues to maintain ties with Taipei, and
                  sells arms to it — but it officially adheres to the PRC's "One
                  China Policy," which states that there is only one legitimate
                  Chinese government. Taiwan is recognised by just 15 nations,
                  the majority of which are small.
                </p>

                <p>
                  However, Taiwan's defence against prospective Chinese invasion
                  is wholly dependent on the United States, which is why any
                  increase in military tensions between China and Taiwan adds to
                  the already fragile ties between Washington and Beijing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Taiwan is a place where the US has a lot of interests. It is
                  one of the world's most stable countries (as well as one of
                  the most dynamic democracies). Taiwan is also a major economic
                  power, producing more than 60% of the world's semiconductors.
                  Beyond that, it has significant strategic significance for the
                  United States: presently, Chinese air and naval forces must
                  travel through Russian, Japanese, Philippine, and Taiwanese
                  territory in order to enter the western Pacific. Meanwhile,
                  Communist China regards Taiwan as a "rogue province," and has
                  said that bringing the island under Beijing's authority is a
                  major foreign policy goal.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the 1990s, as China's economy rose, so did its political
                  power, and Taiwan became increasingly politically isolated. Xi
                  Jinping, China's president, has recently pushed for a more
                  assertive foreign policy and increased expenditure on the
                  People's Liberation Army, particularly troops that might be
                  used to forcefully reintegrate Taiwan into greater China.
                </p>

                <p>So how have the tensions recently escalated?</p>

                <p>
                  The State Department dispatched its highest-ranking mission to
                  Taipei yet last year, amid deteriorating US-China tensions
                  over Covid and trade. The Chinese held a military drill in the
                  Taiwan Strait, which divides Taiwan from mainland China,
                  during the visit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  President Xi Jinping instructed the PLA to prepare for war in
                  October 2020, alarming Taiwan, which saw it as an outright
                  threat.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Taipei raised an alarm about a Chinese warplane invasion early
                  in the Biden Administration, which has vowed a "rock solid"
                  commitment to Taiwan. Taiwan detected Chinese planes in its
                  air defence zone in April. Xi threatened in July to "smash"
                  any Taiwanese push for independence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the Chinese planes returned to Taiwan earlier this month,
                  Taiwanese Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng warned Parliament
                  that China now has the capability to invade Taiwan, but that
                  by 2025, it would be able to “bring the cost and attrition to
                  its lowest.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Xi appeared to assuage concerns of a forcible takeover in a
                  speech on October 10 in which he spoke of "peaceful
                  reunification." Talking about how t The historical mission of
                  the total reunion of the homeland will undoubtedly be
                  realised. On the same day, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen
                  warned that while her administration would not "act rashly,"
                  neither would the Taiwanese people "bend to pressure."
                </p>
                <p>
                  A dispute between China and Taiwan would be devastating,
                  because it would be the first in decades between two highly
                  urbanised, population-dense, technologically sophisticated
                  countries. Not only would this have an impact on the
                  fighting—which would entail stealth aircraft, drones, etc but
                  it would also have an impact on Taiwan's cities. The conflict
                  would put Taiwan's 23 million mainland Chinese nationals who
                  live near coastal air and naval bases, as well as Japanese
                  residents and U.S. military personnel, at jeopardy.

                    Hi! I'm a 19-year-old undergraduate student majoring in
                    Journalism, Psychology and English and a lover of all things
                    art, poetry and music. Shuffling between stargazing and
                    binge watching everything on Netflix, I am usually found
                    scribbling in my journal. With a keen interest in
                    Geopolitics and International Relations and Affairs, I hope
                    to create a difference through my writing.
