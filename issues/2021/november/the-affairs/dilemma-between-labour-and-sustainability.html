                <p>
                  In the fashion industry, there are two types of women: those
                  who make what you wear and those who wear it. That, however,
                  is not the end of the adventure. In fact, there isn't even a
                  speck of it. We discuss inequality, the rich and poor, the
                  gender gap, and other topics, but we rarely discuss the same
                  gender gap. Consider the difference between a woman who is
                  struggling to make ends meet, working in dangerous factories,
                  facing sexual harassment, and who knows what else, and a woman
                  who works in the office, receiving fair pay, respect, and a
                  life. The issue isn't so much their way of life as it is what
                  they did differently to acquire it, and how doing differently
                  created them an image by which we may gauge a country's
                  growth. Most people believe that if a country's women are well
                  dressed or wearing expensive clothes that these women in the
                  same industry can afford, then the country is flourishing, but
                  the reality is found in the factories.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These fashion brands hire labour mostly females from
                  developing countries (such as China, Bangladesh, and India),
                  and as we all know, working conditions for females from these
                  countries in factories are a do or die situation for them.
                  Apart from that, women working in offices are also
                  dissatisfied because they work at lower levels for two
                  reasons: First, homophily, a sociological notion that is
                  widely found in network situations. , in which a person tends
                  to associate with others who are similar to themselves; as all
                  of the high positions in the industry are occupied by males,
                  they talk to other males and it's not about talking, it's
                  about getting comfortable; for example, company parties, where
                  most females prefer not to drink and most of the time they
                  can't stay late, which distinguishes them from the males on
                  the higher level or from lower levels which make their chances
                  of socializing with the other males less ; Second, gender
                  preconceptions such as males being good at agentic skills
                  while women are good at communal skills; hence, they are only
                  dealing with consumers in the hierarchy of responsibilities
                  most of the times .
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apart from the labour routine, these brands move from one
                  location to another in search of cheap labour, as evidenced by
                  the pandemic, in which all lower-level workers are more likely
                  to lose their jobs than higher-level workers; they proudly
                  tell their customers that they are paying their workers fair
                  wages, but this is not the case; they are paying them minimum
                  wages, which keeps them trapped in poverty. For example, these
                  minimal wage jobs would provide them with food or perhaps a
                  reasonable life, but this will compel them to remain poor.
                  They are getting increasingly poor economically, and they are
                  trapped in the cycle for the rest of their lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apart from labour and wages, the fashion industry's biggest
                  issue is that it is producing environmental difficulties; it
                  is responsible for 20% of global garbage, 10% of carbon
                  emissions, and much more, and it is not going to get any
                  better unless we find a solution. The emergence of digital
                  fashion is one option that stands out among a slew of others.
                  Why is it vital to discuss digital fashion? It's significant
                  because it sheds light on customer psychology, their market
                  behaviour, and how they select the best option based on their
                  preferences. Most of the clients, mostly females, want to buy
                  designer garments to post on social media, but most of them
                  cannot afford to do so. It also generates less pollution, but
                  the question is if it is worth it. Will it have an impact on
                  the lives of others who work at lower levels? Will it make the
                  fashion sector more competitive? What kind of fashion do you
                  prefer? Will digital fashion become a method for people to
                  flaunt themselves, and what are the psychological implications
                  of this?
                </p>

                <p>
                  These long-term problems are necessary to consider and
                  address, but it is true that there is a negative correlation
                  between digital fashion and labour in the fashion industry to
                  some level. Not right now, but perhaps in 2050, when society
                  becomes more materialistic and garments go out of fashion
                  every month, it will have an impact on labour, but commenting
                  on how will take some time.

                    fiction, poetry and random things from Tumblr, I like to
                    spoil my walls by drawing things that I copied from
                    Pinterest, my go-to TV channels are Fox Life, CNBC and
                    discovery science. I would prefer living in fantasy than in
                    real life.
