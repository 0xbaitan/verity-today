                <p>
                  Your Hell is not empty and yet the devils are there. Your home
                  is a breathing pulse, beating its way into their jokes and
                  nightmares. A place where the dead “drink dirt and eat stone”
                  and as the seat of ultraviolet flood lights and satyrs dancing
                  to Twin Temple, the concept of heaven and hell through the
                  years has been warped because as humans, probability and
                  assumption is how they access the unknowable. They try to
                  stand at the door between what they see and what they think
                  they would be able to see on another plane. But they stand at
                  the door. Like visitors coming to see the athlete who was
                  crippled in the accident. Cautiously. Because they are
                  terrified of breaking the image, of provoking your wrath. More
                  importantly, of seeing a side they would have rather not seen,
                  in case it changes the well-articulated, emotionally
                  accommodated version of the most terrifying plane they have
                  come up with.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Some call you Hades. They say your world is divided into
                  Tartarus for the worst transgressors, the Fields of Mourning
                  for those wronged by love, and the Asphodel Meadows for the
                  souls of the majority, and the Elysian Fields for the most
                  virtuous, a place you could not set foot in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being the lowest of the regions, the worst, most sinned humans
                  and the enemies of your Father and cousins were to be sent to
                  Tartarus. Kronos, the God of agriculture, driven by power had
                  swallowed his own children to overturn the prophesy which
                  declared that his downfall would be at the hands of his
                  offspring was banished to your realm. You alone know the
                  disgust and the pain of keeping a monster as him around you.
                  You take solace in the fact that those who suffered by him
                  endure it for a year to be then washed away by the Styx into a
                  blissful nothing.
                </p>
               
                <p>
                  There is the one you are truly living. Your throne of skulls
                  and thorns, embedded with rubies as red as the blood of all
                  those who have suffered there. The fires blaze golden around
                  the floating island, spirits screaming from the depths of it.
                  The courtroom with Beelzebub, Asmodeus and Purson gliding in
                  their black robes with flies and moths circling them like the
                  anti-halo. There’s Persephone’s throne, gold with engraved
                  beryls and aquamarines. It’s empty because it’s spring on
                  earth. Flowers you will never breathe. There’s a pristine
                  skull at the base of the throne- a footstool. Your footstool.
                  You are gliding in in your dark green gown, golden at the
                  edges and the golden crown of thorns glimmering on your head.
                  You sit on your throne, your hands on the armrests, your
                  fingers pricked slightly by the thorns drawing blood ever so
                  slightly. You sit up straight, your back taut with power and
                  purpose. Time gazes intently into your face, for even she has
                  not seen something quite so sad and beautiful, your blood red
                  lips and your eyes closed. Eight seconds of ringing silence
                  later, your eyes open sharply, revealing the dark in your
                  irises. The never-ending pit of centuries of souls that have
                  entered, suffering, lost, malicious, their humanity being
                  stripped by their scalding screams. The pain that you have
                  learnt to numb yourself to because you are the ruler and you
                  have to perform your duty to maintain the ecological balance,
                  even if it hollows you inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You want to get up from the throne and dance on the needles
                  that make up the floor of your court. You want to shout from
                  the spires of your castle to all the tortured souls to join
                  you in your dance, offer them respite. You want them to look
                  at you with something other than pure fear. You want to plead
                  at their feet, tears streaming your face, a face that they
                  know not to be human or angel- begging them to understand that
                  you are not evil or shallow. You want to show them that every
                  time they scream, a part of you feels pain much worse than
                  when your wings were ripped from you and you fell from heaven.
                  Your eyes aren’t red with anger, they are stained with the
                  blood of all who suffer, blood you could not wash off. The
                  judgement you have had to make standing on the blurry line
                  between good and bad has haunted you for centuries and it is a
                  cycle that never ends. Robin hood may go to hell for thieving
                  but Elysium waits for he who is remembered as the man who was
                  charitable to the poor. You have tried to stop the trolley
                  that carries the life of many against that of one. One
                  innocent human. But it has been running frictionless on the
                  track of cruel helplessness. And that trolley rolls its way
                  into what humans believe happens to them after death because
                  the only thing they like believing more than that they are
                  meant for Asphodel at worst, is that they are immortal. That
                  they are more than the ashes that cement over hundreds of
                  years. They believe that those ashes will be the founding
                  stone of the next civilization and they will play their part
                  in that too. The part of them beyond the ashes goes to you to
                  tide time till called upon. You try to warn them, you are
                  screaming yourself hoarse telling them to keep away but they
                  are just out of earshot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The seven deadly sins that flew out of innocent Pandora’s box
                  were pride, sloth, greed, gluttony, wrath, envy and lust. You
                  never wanted to let them out. You wanted to keep them buried
                  under your floorboards forever, forgotten. These spirits that
                  you let out have been precursors to every disaster, every
                  heartbreak and is part of them. And yet, they like to believe
                  that they are all not destined for eternal damnation. So do
                  you, in futility. It isn’t blind faith that ties in them the
                  belief that who they are beyond their vessels aren’t angry
                  wraiths fighting their way away from you. They believe it
                  because of that last spirit that glowed brightest in the end.
                  Take comfort in that, oh doomed, beautiful one.
