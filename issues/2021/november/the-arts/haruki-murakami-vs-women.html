                <p>
                  Haruki Murakami has managed to earn a huge name for himself in
                  the world of English Literature. The Japanese writer is known
                  for his eccentric tales which weave reality with fantasy, and
                  create a form of escapism that is unique to his work. However,
                  one of the most controversial aspects of his work is his
                  depiction of women and the role they play in his stories,
                  which has made him the subject of feminist critique over the
                  years. While the author himself provides negligible context to
                  most of his writings, it is interesting to see how the 21st
                  century feminist movement throws light on his work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Murakami’s world of fiction is one in which the male
                  protagonists are unravelling their own dilemmas in a different
                  dimension, while the women are left to face reality. If you’ve
                  read enough of his work, it is easy to glean a pattern
                  emerging in these male protagonists- they are aloof,
                  disconnected from the world and seeking to recover something
                  they have lost. Their journey of recovery often blurs the
                  lines between reality and fantasy, and ends with a spiritual
                  awakening at the end. They are eccentric but likeable, and are
                  often supplemented by other male characters whose mystery and
                  charm makes them very attractive on paper.
                </p>
                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid"
                    src="/articles/2021/november/the-arts/haruki-murakami-vs-women/IMG2.jpg"
                    alt=""

                <p>
                  Female characters, on the other hand, see a vastly different
                  narrative. Generally, supporting women are sculpted to fit one
                  of two roles- the self-sacrificing caregiver or the courtesan.
                  Murakami's work contains a whole spectrum of different women-
                  some who exude a confident charm like their male counterparts,
                  some who are quiet and passive and some who exist for sexual
                  gratification of the protagonist only. Murakami has often said
                  that these sexual activities in his work don’t exist just for
                  the sake of existing. There is always an ulterior motive-
                  something philosophical, which exists as a stepping stone for
                  the protagonist to either unveil his character or move further
                  to recovering what he has lost. Hence, his women characters
                  aren’t meant to be vessels of sexual gratification, but rather
                  key components to develop the plot.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But this begs the question- is the existence of these
                  characters still justifiable? When you pick up certain
                  characters, it often becomes difficult to understand their
                  motives or gauge the morality of their existence. Take for
                  example 13-year-old Mariye Akigawa from Killing Commendatore.
                  Her first encounter with the middle-aged protagonist resulted
                  in her discussing her breasts (or lack thereof) in great
                  detail. Clearly, this young teenager saw this 40 something
                  year old man as a sexual object. However, in a 2017 interview
                  with Mieko Kawakami, Murakami said that the very fact that she
                  brought up the subject of her breasts meant that she regarded
                  him as anything but a sexual object, which made their
                  conversation completely introspective. Mariye can be
                  contrasted to characters like May Kasahara from The Wind Up
                  Bird Chronicle, who exhibited a kind of profundity very
                  unusual for someone her age. Some of her dialogues were
                  surprisingly intelligent, and she is, perhaps, one of
                  Murakami's most layered characters.

                <p>
                  Coming back to Killing Commendatore, the character of Menshiki
                  was one of Murakami's typical supporting characters-
                  mysterious, suave and always calculated. His personality was
                  reflected in Mariye's aunt, Shoko Akigawa, who was mainly
                  described by the clothes she wore (a very common Murakami
                  technique of describing women). Very little was revealed about
                  her throughout the course of the story, which made her all the
                  more intriguing and placed her on the same pedestal as that of
                  male supporting characters like Menshiki. Another example of
                  powerful female characters would be in his novel After Dark,
                  where a majority of the characters were women (including the
                  protagonist, Mari Asai). Characters like Kaoru, and those of
                  the workers working at the Love Hotel were also
                  multidimensional and complex, and displayed real human
                  emotions that made them stand out. They were flawed and
                  relatable, and it was through them that the story progressed
                  seamlessly. Here, it is also worth mentioning Norwegian Wood's
                  Naoko and Midori, who each stood out in their own way and
                  propelled the protagonist to make his decisions in the story.
                </p>
                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid"
                    src="/articles/2021/november/the-arts/haruki-murakami-vs-women/IMG4.jpg"

                <p>
                  Some other popular women characters from Murakami's novels fit
                  into the category of the self-sacrificing oracle- the ones who
                  are rooted in reality and end up shedding their blood while
                  the male protagonist is lost in the subconscious. Some of
                  Murakami's most iconic full-length novels follow this
                  sequence, like how in The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, Toru Okada's
                  wife Kumiko was the one who killed Noboru Wataya by pulling
                  his life support plug. Similarly, in 1Q84, Aomame was the one
                  who killed the Leader and had to face its consequences. Almost
                  none of the male protagonists have had to adopt this role, and
                  although Murakami has repeatedly said that the characters he
                  creates transcend gender, this common trope is much too
                  overused for it to not be frustrating.
                </p>
                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid"
                    src="/articles/2021/november/the-arts/haruki-murakami-vs-women/IMG5.jpg"

                </div>
                <p>
                  Lastly, one can't really discuss Murakami's women characters
                  without bringing up his short story Sleep. Written entirely
                  from a woman’s perspective, this story was so fantastic that
                  on its first English publication, flocks of American women
                  wrote to Murakami saying how much they resonated with the
                  character.
                </p>
                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid"
                    src="/articles/2021/november/the-arts/haruki-murakami-vs-women/IMG6.jpg"
                    alt=""
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Based on a woman who is unable to sleep, the story went beyond
                  just "bored-housewife syndrome" and captured the universally
                  resonant emotion of loneliness. It is these characters that
                  truly capture the human experience in an expertly subtle way,
                  and make the reader feel a genuine sense of empathy and
                  understanding- something that the author does very well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All in all, it has become evident that Murakami's depiction of
                  women is too diverse to fit into a general category. They all
                  possess a sense of individualism typical of his characters,
                  and while they may be questionable at times, there is no doubt
                  that they are too well written to be classified as black or
                  white. Though it is impossible to gauge Murakami's position on
                  the feminist ladder, there is no doubt that his works will be
                  celebrated for decades to come. Perhaps the Nobel next time?
