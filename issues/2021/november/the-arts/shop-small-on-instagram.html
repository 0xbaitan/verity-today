                <p class="heading">1. Memoroids</p>

                <p>
                  Shivangi Biswas started Memoroids- a hub for Polaroids prints
                  on film, frames, Polaroid holders, gift hampers, on 13th May,
                  2020 when she felt that school demotivated her and made her
                  feel that she wasn’t worth something. We all need something to
                  hold onto on our worst days for Shivangi it was this, when her
                  friend motivated her to start this venture and she feels
                  confident now more than ever. She has made round about 90
                  sales and counting and invests in an enjoyable unboxing
                  experience for her customers, while keeping packing simple but
                  cute and colour coordinated. Her secret to motivation when
                  there are no orders placed is “Knowing that no matter what
                  happens, I am performing to my full and utmost capacity and
                  that I should proud of myself for whatever I’ve achieved, no
                  matter how little or how less.” Her hard work on frames and
                  wooden polaroid is very much visible when it’s a finished
                  work, and I’m sure will match most of our aesthetics. However,
                  it’s not always roses and sunflowers for her either. She faces
                  some very common problems like rude customers, ghosting, and
                  bargaining, finances, not enough orders but at the end of the
                  day she said, “We should be proud of ourselves for doing what
                  we are and give ourselves a pat on our backs for coming this
                  far.”

                <p class="heading">2. Cakewalk by Rahas</p>

                <p>
                  The Raha sisters, Nandini and Shreyanshi started this home
                  bakery to serve “melt in mouth, perfectly balanced cakes” on
                  18th January, 2021. The baker duo of Raha family was always
                  fond of cooking and baking, and received immense amount of
                  support from family and friends, but never did the thought of
                  turning a passion into a business start-up crossed their mind
                  until recently when they noticed that people switched to
                  home-run bakeries which according to them was safer during the
                  ongoing pandemic. Their menu allows us to explore a wide range
                  of cakes and cookies, and their bestsellers are lemon and
                  strawberry cake, but you can also try brownies, brownie cake
                  pop, double chocolate cookies and granola bars and oatmeal
                  cookies are a special item for fitness freaks, with 80
                  successful orders the duo is all set to treat your taste buds.
                  To pack the order in the post elegant and hygienic order, they
                  make sure to follow all sanitation process making the unboxing
                  experience a mouth-watering one. With work for one and studies
                  for another surely running a bakery isn’t easy because it’s
                  not a two minutes job but requires a large amount of patience,
                  to keep up with motivation “The days I don't get an order I
                  usually cook a meal for myself and binge watch a series on
                  Netflix.” said Nandini. As we all know that a coin has two
                  sides, similarly they face some trouble with continuous price
                  negotiations and dealing with too many orders but one
                  equipment for making, but nonetheless it does not stop the duo
                  from growing and learning.

                <p>
                  “Have you heard of bees getting stuck in amber and being
                  preserved for ages? Leaves frozen in snow? The work I do is
                  almost the same, except it's in a form you can keep close to
                  your heart, forever.” Is how Rajshree introduced her small
                  business, which started sometime in October,2020 at 2:00am
                  when she sat with a bunch of pressed flowers, a bottle of
                  memories and tons of memories she wasn’t ready to let go of.
                  What was merely started as a resin botanical jewellery store
                  has now expanded to resin home décor and curated charm
                  jewellery, and has received around about 900+ orders. Most of
                  the items are resin made and need to be dealt with a lot of
                  patience, while finishing really gives birth to a yearn for
                  such beauty hand-made with love. Rajshree on being asked about
                  the speciality of her packaging said, “The 'thank you letter'
                  I add isn't just a letter appreciating the purchase, it's a
                  letter from me to you, with LOTS OF LOVE” and from personal
                  experience reading the letter does provide one with a sense of
                  warmth and belonging to a clan.

                <p>
                  Shalini’s love for plants is beyond any measure and she wanted
                  to share this love and experience with others as well, so she
                  asked her daughter Teena to help her setup a business account
                  for the same in July, 2021. The business is managed by Shalini
                  and her two daughters; they extend variety in plants and
                  planters- ceramic and terracotta which undeniably attracts
                  buyers appreciating nature and promises more calm and peaceful
                  environment. With 25-30 orders, the green family isn’t
                  demotivate but understand that their business will reach its
                  peak even those hurdles will create disturbances, “It's normal
                  to not get orders every day, we just keep focusing on our
                  plants to keep ourselves motivated. The love for taking care
                  of plants is why we started this business and plants don't
                  grow in one day, it takes time for steady growth” said Teena.
                  The thing that charms customers is the 100% green and
                  eco-friendly packaging, which underlines the need for less
                  pollution in whatever way possible.

                <p class="heading">5. Ayda by Ayesha</p>

                <p>
                  How often do we come across business owners who don’t believe
                  in sugar-coating, well Ayesha is one of those. She started her
                  venture inspired by others small businesses, and also desired
                  to showcase her creativity by putting into some productive
                  use. Ayesha is definitely filled with a lot of life, when
                  asked about her motivational secret she said- “I have this
                  craZe of earning money. That is one thing that keeps me
                  going.” She has received 40 orders and deals in a variety of
                  goods, starting from premium quality leather products, vintage
                  shirts and handmade jewellery and phone charms using beads and
                  pearls. A very important positive side of owning a small
                  business is that it is not supposed to leave you to deal with
                  stress and sleepless nights but let you enjoy through the
                  process, something Ayesha experiences “I used colourful sugar
                  beads to make rings, anklets, bracelets, chokers and
                  necklaces. I also make bracelets and anklets out of embroidery
                  threads which definitely reminds me of my school days.”
                  Alongside the happiness, when potential customers ghost after
                  a detailed conversation for products it is disappointing in
                  addition to users unfollowing over a period of time. The small
                  business radiates life and optimistic vibes just like a sun
                  shining in the morning.

                  <p>
                    Hi, I’m Dipali Banka (she/her)- a proud feminist, a
                    heterosexual and an aspiring journalist. My love for books
                    started when I picked up my first Harry Potter and now I’m
                    reading more of the political genre. I love to volunteer for
                    social causes at NGOs and I adore Taylor Swift and Sylvia
                    Plath because they help me understand my emotions.
