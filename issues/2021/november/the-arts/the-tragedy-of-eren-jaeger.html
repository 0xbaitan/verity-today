                <p>
                  The year is 845. Humanity is said to have perished due to the
                  tyranny of gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as
                  Titans. What remains of the human race, is protected from
                  these monsters behind three humongous walls namely, Maria,
                  Rose, and Sina. The walls protect humanity from its otherwise
                  cruel fate, they block out the harsh reality and let humans
                  live prosperously for however long they can manage. The walls
                  haven’t been breached in 100 years though. The walls provide
                  safety, people of the walls cheer, humanity shall prevail,
                  they hope.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Eren Jaeger, at the mere age of 9 however, vehemently
                  disagrees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The walls may provide safety but at the cost of freedom. For
                  nine-year-old Eren, who is hot-tempered and rigid, who is
                  righteous and is curious, who loves his mother and wants
                  nothing more than to taste the salty water of the sea and
                  marvel at the beauty of the world; for Eren Jaeger, the world
                  is a strict black and white, and the walls provide him safety
                  but they take away the one thing more essential to him than
                  his mother’s hugs and his friend, Armin’s philosophical
                  quips--the walls take away his freedom and freedom, Eren
                  believes, is something every human should have.

                <p>
                  Attack on Titan, created by Hajima Isayama, creates a world
                  wherein death runs rampant. Loss and the shattering
                  realization that this all accounts for nothing are found at
                  every corner. Within the walls of Rose, defeat, and mourning
                  for the loss of wall Maria and its people continues; Humanity
                  stands halfway between eradication and survival, and between
                  the screaming and fighting, stands a 15-year-old Eren, with a
                  strong resolve, and a vow to eradicate the race of Titans that
                  stole his town, mother and dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is only unfortunate that after an enthusiastic exchange
                  with his fellow soldiers whilst on duty, Eren finds himself
                  facing the very Colossal Titan that kickstarted the attack on
                  his hometown of Shiganshina. Eren finds himself being hauled
                  left and right by Armin in an effort to protect them from the
                  stream of Titans entering wall Rose. Eren watches helplessly
                  as his fellow soldiers die the most horrendous deaths, whilst
                  the remaining soldiers scramble about trying to decide whether
                  they’re helpful or helpless. It is then that Eren realizes
                  just how powerless he is. So, when Eren’s hand finally slips
                  from Armin’s and he goes straight down the throat of a Titan,
                  death seems bittersweet, but almost deserved. In hindsight,
                  Eren would’ve died knowing he lived a somewhat happy life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Eren doesn’t die then, he only discovers his Titan
                  abilities. He doesn’t die anytime soon either but he comes
                  close to it a couple of times, and each time he realizes that
                  the peace of knowing he lived a happy life becomes more and
                  more unattainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Death becomes an unwanted friend of Eren and his friends in
                  all its all-consuming glory. For Eren, watching the people he
                  loves most, die is worse than his own run-ins with death. What
                  he doesn’t know at fifteen though, is that, soon enough, death
                  will be his hope in the future--his hope for salvation from
                  his cruel world.

                <p>
                  Eren watches as his entire squad gets trampled by Titans, he
                  watches his three comrades turn out to be Titans themselves,
                  he watches people get killed one by one, all of their deaths
                  being solely for their will to protect him. His relationship
                  with death gets more and more convoluted until he realizes
                  with a startle, that he is the cause of all this destruction
                  and almost paradoxically, the people around him chant his
                  importance to the survival of humanity. At fifteen, Eren
                  trusts the people around him more than he trusts himself and
                  so, he lets their voices drown out the incessant need to
                  embrace the destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Season three of Attack on Titan starts with an exploration of
                  the political scenario of the walls. This time, the enemy
                  isn’t the Titans, it’s humans. The main cast grapples with the
                  reality of having to resort to such morally ambiguous deeds,
                  as they slowly transition from cut-throat soldiers to
                  hesitating assassins. The blood on their hands still haunts
                  them but it haunts no one more than Eren who has convinced
                  himself that his death is the only way forward for humanity.
                  More importantly, that he can almost accept death at this
                  point in his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is something haunting about seeing Eren’s descent from a
                  kid who was ready to charge headfirst into battle just a few
                  months ago, welcoming death despite his hesitance. He doesn’t
                  want to fight anymore, but unfortunately for him, this is just
                  the beginning of the destruction, he will be the sole cause
                  of.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Part two of Season three takes us back to the town that
                  started it all. Nostalgia is denied entry because a brutal
                  fight has to be fought against the people who turned
                  Shiganshina into the ghost town it is today. Eren puts aside
                  all his emotional baggage to fight, only for a total of nine
                  people to make it out of the fight. The mission had been to
                  get to Eren’s father’s basement, with the key, Eren has had
                  ever since the beginning, and when Eren gets to his house he’s
                  not returned to in six years, they find a book that changes
                  the course of not only Eren’s life but also of the entire
                  human population. The people of the walls now have a name,
                  they’re Eldians.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Eldians have a more complicated history than being mere
                  survivors of humanity. Eldians can turn into Titans but except
                  for the nine Titans derived from their founder, Ymir, all of
                  them turn into mindless giant humanoids, with no consciousness
                  except for the need to eat humans. Eldians were once the
                  oppressors but are now the oppressed, especially Eldians on
                  the island of Paradise, unaware of their ancestors’ deeds and
                  left in the dark with a warped version of their apocalyptic
                  past, left to die without any redemption. Eren used to think
                  that freedom lied outside the walls, only for his perception
                  of the world to be turned on its head, and suddenly, freedom
                  was nowhere to be found. There were only wars to be fought and
                  revenge to be taken.
                </p>

                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  So Eren finally turns towards destruction. For the first time
                  in his life, he embraces his role in the world fully, and lets
                  go of everyone and everything he loves because if he cannot
                  achieve freedom in life, he can achieve it in death. Eren
                  becomes ruthless. He kills to get what he wants, he’s ready to
                  sacrifice the entire world for the protection of his homeland,
                  and when the people around him are forced to see him in the
                  light he has seen himself in for so long, Eren knows, for
                  once, he’s successfully completed his mission. Eren accepts
                  death, and destruction, and all the things he never wanted to
                  be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eren Jaeger dies at age nineteen, after having lived a life of
                  sheer chaos and unrest. Eren dies at age nineteen, and he is
                  finally free from this cruel, cruel world.
