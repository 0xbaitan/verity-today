                <p>
                  I was about seven years old when, one day, I found a painting
                  in a big box of old things my mother said she had brought from
                  her mother’s house when she got married many years ago. The
                  painting was old, its wooden frame had chipped at the edges.
                  It was almost as tall as me and much wider, but of the many
                  books and portraits and photographs in the box, this was the
                  one that caught my eye. The painting showed a man standing
                  under a blossoming tree with a flute to his lips and a peacock
                  feather stuck in his curly hair. He wore a yellow dhoti, had a
                  garland around his neck, and was adorned with a great many
                  jewels. But the strange thing about this man was that his skin
                  was the darkest shade of blue, making him look almost ethereal
                  with all the shining gold and pearls on him. Next to him stood
                  the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Her skin was fair,
                  almost milky white, and her hair was tied in a braid that was
                  decorated with flowers. She was adorned with fewer jewels than
                  the man next to her, but with more flowers, making her look
                  simpler, kinder, and more human. She wore a long white skirt
                  and a light pink cloth was tied around her upper body. I
                  noticed that the man and the woman were standing very close to
                  each other, their eyes locked in a loving gaze. Her hands
                  rested on the man’s shoulders, her body partially leaning on
                  his, and she looked at him like he had designed all of
                  Creation just for her. Little did I know then that I wasn’t
                  far off the mark.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The woman intrigued me for reasons I can’t explain even now,
                  nearly twenty years later. With great difficulty, I picked up
                  the large, heavy painting and somehow managed to carry it to
                  my mother, who was sewing a blouse in the next room. I sat
                  down next to her to ask her about it, hoping the painting
                  would catch her attention more than the fact that I had found
                  it while sneaking around in her cupboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Mother,” I said, timidly. She stopped her sewing to look up
                  at me and I turned the painting to her. “Who are these
                  people?”
                </p>

                <p>
                  My mother smiled at the painting and then at me. “That is
                  Krishna, a form of Vishnu, one of the gods we worship. His
                  portrait is there in your father’s room among the other gods.
                  Haven’t you noticed it before?”
                </p>
                <p>I shook my head to say no. “And, who is the woman?”</p>
                <p>“That is Radha, Krishna’s eternal consort.”</p>
                <p>
                  “What does a consort mean? Does it mean a Goddess? If she
                  isn’t a Goddess, why is she in the painting? Can humans be
                  next to gods?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  She laughed at my curiosity and ruffled my hair. “A consort
                  means someone you love very much, like Krishna loves Radha.
                  She is considered to be a Goddess by some people and they
                  worship both of them. Some think she is just a human being
                  Krishna loved whose devotion towards him made her memory
                  immortal in our minds. Either way, she appears in the painting
                  because Krishna loves her and wants her by his side.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Well, how did Krishna meet her? Are they married, like you
                  and Father?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  At that question, her face fell a little, as though she was
                  feeling another’s sadness. “No, they are not married. When
                  Krishna met her, he was much younger than he seems to be in
                  this painting. Perhaps three or four years older than you. But
                  Radha was seventeen or eighteen and already married to another
                  man. So Krishna could never marry her.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was puzzled. I did not know that a woman could love another
                  man when she had already been married. If she did not love her
                  husband, why did she marry him then? “Tell me their story.”
                </p>
                <p>“You want to know Krishna’s story?”</p>
                <p>“Yes. And Radha’s too.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Well, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva. Devaki was the
                  cousin sister of Kansa, the prince of a place called Mathura
                  and he hated almost everyone but his sister. But on her
                  wedding day, there was a prophecy that her and Vasudeva’s
                  eighth son would kill Kansa because he was an evil man who
                  scared the people. The thought of his death scared—”
                </p>
                <p>
                  I stopped her here. “Mother, this is about neither Krishna nor
                  Radha! Tell me stories about them, about their love. It must
                  not have been easy for Radha, being married to a different
                  man.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Okay then. Once upon a time, in a village called Vrindavan…”
                  And my mother went on to narrate a story that I now know as
                  well as my own name.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story was full of demons and young boys, gopis and
                  beautiful dances, cows and stealing butter, miracles and a
                  great many interesting things. The story was about Krishna’s
                  childhood and triumphs. It was a hero’s story, and a great one
                  too. But that day, nearly twenty years ago, it wasn’t he who
                  had caught my attention in the painting. I listened to my
                  mother with rapt attention but I didn’t understand one thing:
                  if Radha was barely there in the story at all, why was she
                  important enough to be in the painting?
                </p>
                <p>
                  My mind was full of questions. I waited for my mother to
                  finish the part about Krishna leaving Vrindavan, and then
                  asked her, “Mother, did Krishna ever come back?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “No, he did not. He knew he was meant for bigger things in
                  life. He had a more important destiny to fulfil, which he
                  could only do if he left Vrindavan.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “But then, what happened to Radha? He just left her? How could
                  he leave her if he loved her? He may have gone on to do
                  greater things, but what of her? What happens to the woman
                  left behind?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  My mother stopped and looked at me with a puzzled expression
                  on her face, as though I had just asked her a question she had
                  never thought about before. But that expression disappeared
                  just as suddenly as it had come and she smiled fondly at me
                  again. “Sometimes, we have to leave behind the ones we love
                  for the greater good. Radha never raised questions about why
                  Krishna left her because she believed in his love. We
                  shouldn’t question their love either. Now, put the painting
                  back where you found it and go outside and play. Let me get
                  back to my stitching.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was bursting with a hundred more questions. What happened to
                  her after he left? What is her story? Did she ever see him
                  again? How was she not hurt by this? He may have gone on to
                  fulfil greater destinies, but did he leave his consort behind
                  in a little village in an unhappy marriage with no bigger
                  destiny for her? I wanted to ask my mother all these things
                  but I could sense that she wasn’t going to answer any more of
                  my questions today so I got up and did as she had asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the question lingered in my mind. I spent hours imagining
                  elaborate scenarios about Radha’s life, her heartbreak, and
                  her sorrow after Krishna left her. Ever since then, I’ve read
                  a great many books, I’ve asked my father, my grandparents, my
                  friends, I’ve even consulted scholars and looked it up on the
                  internet, but I haven’t found the answer to my question even
                  today.

                    class ten in La Martiniere for Girls. When I'm not writing
                    angry articles about our messy world, I like re-watching
