                <p>
                  COVID-19 has swept the world ever since its first appearance,
                  forcing us into global quarantine and changing the trajectory
                  of the lives of most forever. In desperate attempts to escape
                  the quarantine that has tied people down within their homes,
                  many have been hoping for the release of a vaccine to return
                  us all to “normal”. Plenty of viable options for vaccines have
                  been made, notably Pfizer’s, Covaxin, Johnson and Johnson,
                  Covishield, and more. However, as these vaccines provide a
                  temporary solution to the worldwide issue of the pandemic, the
                  population that refuses to get any such vaccines seems to grow
                  by the day, further lengthening the period of time that we are
                  forced to remain in isolation. While their scepticism may be
                  harmful towards other people suffering due to the pandemic,
                  they use thorough scientific reasoning and evidence from
                  famous doctors to back up their claims.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These vaccines are arguably the solution to the problem we
                  have been facing the last two years; yet, a sizable minority
                  of the world still chooses to deny it. Political and
                  psychological aspects aside, we can infer that this is largely
                  due to any sort of scientific evidence they can use to support
                  their claims. Certain vaccines would face halts in production
                  and distribution due to a wide number of absurd results in
                  patients receiving the vaccine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Firstly, the Johnson and Johnson vaccine was a stable option
                  at the time for people who needed to travel around and
                  required a vaccine as quickly as possible. Upon a thorough
                  investigation of the vaccine, however, the presence of
                  numerous rare blood clots was discovered in people who have
                  received it, particularly adult women under the age of 50.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After careful review, the vaccine halted production and
                  distribution around the time of April this year but was later
                  approved by the FDA and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) to resume the administration of the vaccine. The
                  situation itself, however, seemed particularly dangerous and
                  resulted in one of the first vaccine scares.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The J&J vaccine caused global paranoia amongst people who were
                  already very sceptical about COVID-19 vaccines in the first
                  place. While considered to be safe, women under the age of 50
                  taking the vaccine need to be aware of the adverse effects,
                  and for three weeks after getting the vaccine, possible
                  symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets called thrombosis
                  with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, may appear.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Similarly, many have observed such rare conditions resulting
                  from other vaccines as well. A prime example is the infamous
                  Pfizer vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, due to which rare
                  occurrences of myocarditis began to appear, following its
                  second injection. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart
                  muscle (myocardium). The inflammation can reduce the heart's
                  ability to pump, weakening it and leading to heart failure,
                  abnormal heartbeat and sudden death. These conditions are
                  treatable if treated at the right time, but could prove to be
                  fatal over time. Another cause for this widespread scepticism
                  and refusal to accept the vaccine sparks from fear of the
                  various side effects, ranging from fever, muscle aches,
                  chills, fatigue, headaches to a combination of these symptoms.
                </p>

                  Michael Yeadon is a former vice president of Pfizer, where he
                  spent 16 years as an allergy and respiratory researcher. He
                  later co-founded a biotech firm that the Swiss drugmaker
                  Novartis purchased for at least $325 million. As of recent
                  times, he has emerged as a public icon, representative of the
                  “anti-vax” community. The reluctance and grand movement to
                  refuse vaccines has amplified his sceptical views on the
                  vaccine and lockdowns.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Michael Yeadon said that he personally doesn’t oppose the use
                  of all vaccines. But many health experts and government
                  officials worry that opinions like his, which question the
                  validity and safety of the vital vaccines, can potentially
                  fuel vaccine hesitancy – a reluctance or refusal to be
                  vaccinated – that could prolong the pandemic. In fact, he was
                  one of the few that had signed the petition to halt the
                  distribution of vaccines as it made women infertile, despite
                  test results stating that only 13% of the women who received
                  the vaccine were infertile.

                <p>
                  From a scientific perspective, recent reports of blood clots
                  and abnormal bleeding in a small number of recipients of
                  AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine have cast doubt on that shot’s
                  safety, leading several European countries to suspend its use.
                  These developments are likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy
                  further, although there is no evidence of a causative link
                  between the AstraZeneca product and the affected patients’
                  conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is essentially this credibility that evokes fear in
                  citizens across the world, wondering if they are truly free of
                  any health concerns that could potentially lead to lifelong
                  torment. Luckily, safety is considered a top priority in the
                  manufacturing of such vaccines. Trials for the vaccines have
                  had fully independent safety monitoring boards, and safety
                  data are continuously reviewed by the FDA and expert panels.
                  The number of serious problems in test participants was very
                  low, and there was little difference between those who
                  received the actual vaccine and those who received a placebo.
                  Millions of people have received the vaccines since their
                  authorization, and careful safety monitoring of all three
                  COVID-19 vaccines continues.

                    I'm a 16 year old studying at Calcutta International School,
                    with a deep rooted love for all things space and writing.
                    Learning about new concepts in STEM is always an ideal way
                    for me to pass my time, and writing about it applies that
                    journey to my hobby of writing. I even get to learn more
                    about such concepts through research while writing articles
                    myself.
