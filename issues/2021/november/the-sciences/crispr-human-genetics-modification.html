                  Genome editing or gene modification gives scientists the
                  ability to change the DNA of a living organism. These
                  technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or
                  modified at a specific location in the genome. Many approaches
                  have been used for genome editing. The most effective and
                  up-to-date is known as CRISPR-Cas9, short for “Clustered
                  Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR
                  Associated Protein 9”. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has generated
                  much enthusiasm in the scientific community because it is
                  faster, cheaper, more accurate and more efficient than other
                  existing genome editing methods. CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from
                  a natural genome editing system in bacteria. As the founder
                  says, “bacteria take DNA fragments from invading viruses and
                  use them to create DNA segments which are known as CRISPR
                  arrays.” These arrays allow bacteria to "remember" viruses (or
                  closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the
                  bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to attack
                  the DNA of the viruses. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a
                  similar enzyme to cut the DNA, which in turn inactivates the
                  virus.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Jennifer Doudna is a household name in the world of CRISPR,
                  and she is considered responsible for the invention of CRISPR.
                  Dr Doudna was one of the first scientists to suggest that this
                  microbial immunity mechanism could be used for programmable
                  genome editing. This tool has the potential to change the
                  genetic makeup of any and all organisms and solve an infinite
                  number of problems. Dr Doudna's discovery changed the world of
                  genetic modification, as the techniques used before the
                  development of CRISPR were time-consuming, tedious, and not as
                  convenient. In 2020, Dr Doudna and Dr Charpentier won the
                  Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering CRISPR. Some bacteria
                  have a built-in gene-editing system similar to the CRISPR-Cas9
                  system that they use to respond to invading pathogens like a
                  virus, similar to an immune system. With CRISPR, bacteria cut
                  parts of the virus' DNA and retain some of it so that they can
                  recognize the virus in the next attack and defend the body
                  against it. Scientists adapted this system so that it can be
                  used in other animal cells, including mice and humans.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The CRISPR-Cas9 system consists of two key molecules that
                  introduce a change (mutation) In DNA. There is an enzyme,
                  called Cas9. These act as "molecular scissors" that can cut
                  the two strands of DNA at a specific point in the genome so
                  that DNA fragments can then be added or removed. The second is
                  a piece of RNA called guide RNA (gRNA). It consists of a small
                  piece of pre-made RNA sequence (about 20 bases long) that sits
                  within a longer RNA scaffold. The frame part binds to DNA and
                  the premade sequence "leads" Cas9 to the right side of the
                  genome. This ensures that the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA in the
                  correct place in the genome. Guide RNA was developed to find
                  and bind to a specific sequence in DNA. The main RNA have
                  bases that are complementary to those of the target DNA
                  sequence in the genome. This means that the guide RNA, at
                  least in theory, only binds to the target sequence and not to
                  other regions of the genome. Cas9 follows the lead RNA to the
                  same place in the DNA sequence and cuts through both strands
                  of DNA. The cell here recognizes that the DNA is damaged and
                  begins the process to repair it. Scientists use the DNA repair
                  machinery to make changes to one or more genes in the genome
                  of a cell of interest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Usually, the guide RNA consists of a specific sequence of 20
                  bases. These are complementary to the target sequence in the
                  gene to be edited, however not all 20 bases have to match for
                  the guide RNA to bind. The problem with this is that a
                  sequence with several complementary bases such as 19-20 bases
                  can exist in a completely different place in the genome. This
                  means that the guide RNA can possibly bind there instead of
                  with the target sequence. The Cas9 enzyme then cuts in the
                  wrong place and ends up introducing a mutation in the wrong
                  place. While this mutation may not matter at all for the
                  individual, it could affect a critical gene or some other
                  important part of the genome.
                </p>

                <p>
                  CRISPR-Cas9 has great potential as a tool to treat a number of
                  diseases with a genetic component, such as cancer, hepatitis
                  B, and even high cholesterol. Many of the proposed uses
                  involve editing the genomes of somatic (non-reproductive)
                  structures, but there has been much interest and discussion
                  about the potential for germline manipulation of cells
                  (reproductive). Since all changes made in germline cells are
                  passed down from generation to generation, it has important
                  ethical implications. Germline gene editing is currently
                  illegal in the UK and most other countries. On the other hand,
                  the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and other gene-editing technologies on
                  living cells is unparalleled as of now. In fact, they have
                  been used to treat human diseases in a small number of rare
                  and/or life-threatening cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is likely that many years will pass before CRISPR-Cas9 is
                  used routinely in humans. Much research is still focused on
                  its use in animal models or isolated human cells with the goal
                  of eventually using the technology for the routine treatment
                  of diseases in humans. There is much work focused on
                  eliminating "off-target" effects where the CRISPR-Cas9 system
                  cuts a different gene than the one that should be edited.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Scientists are eager to find a way to ensure that CRISPR-Cas9
                  will adhere and cut accurately. This can be achieved in two
                  ways: a) by designing better and more specific guide RNAs
                  using our knowledge of the genome's DNA sequence and the
                  "off-target" behaviour of different versions of the Cas9-gRNA
                  complex, b) the use of a Cas9 enzyme that only cuts a single
                  strand of the target DNA instead of the double-strand. This
                  means that two Cas9 enzymes and two guide RNAs must be in the
                  same place for the cut to take place. This will reduce the
                  likelihood of the cut being made in the wrong place.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is not a perfect system. Occasionally cutting in the wrong
                  place and not working as expected causes scientists to scratch
                  their heads. Well, there are few research solutions that can
                  help CRISPR identify more than 90% of all genetic diseases.
                  There are certain problems with CRISPR, but there are
                  solutions to these as well. It can be used for cloning, which
                  would increase the dangers and likelihood of identity theft.
                  Since we can edit any gene, this could encourage people to
                  edit their genes as desirable (for bigger muscles or faster
                  metabolism, for instance), which could increase competition
                  between people with similar desirable genes and lead to a
                  tougher society in which anyone with unwanted genes would be
                  discriminated against.
                </p>

                <p>
                  CRISPR is still in its early stages but the scientists of the
                  world anxiously hold their breaths in hopes that this newfound
                  technology will be able to accomplish what no human has
                  before: changing an organism from the inside out.
