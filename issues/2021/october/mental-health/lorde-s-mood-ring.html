                <p class="excert">
                  After a torturous wait of more than four years, Kiwi artist
                  Lorde finally put out her third studio album, ‘Solar Power’, a
                  follow-up to the sultry, Grammy-nominated ‘Melodrama’ from
                  2017. Revamped with a whole new sound and aesthetic, Solar
                  Power explores the healing qualities of the Sun and Lorde’s
                  intimacy with nature following her recovery from the
                  adolescent angst and heartbreak of her previous album. As
                  such, the record tends to take on quite a spiritual presence,
                  delving into different practices of wellness culture, although
                  not necessarily framing these in an entirely positive light.
                  The ambiguity towards such applications is best seen in her
                  latest single, ‘Mood Ring’, which also happens to be my
                  personal favourite from the album.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an interview with Genius, Lorde said that the character in
                  the song is not her; it is a satirical take on a person
                  “seeking wellness, enlightenment, or even utopia”. As such,
                  the song explored various tropes of spirituality and
                  well-being, which more often than not have been appropriated
                  by Western societies and white-washed. Mood Ring, hence, is a
                  commentary on the modern person’s need to have coping
                  mechanisms to deal with the turmoil of everyday life. Usually,
                  the people partaking in such mechanisms do not have much
                  knowledge about the origins of these practices, or even why
                  they do what they do. Sometimes, it serves as an instrument of
                  socialisation to fit in with others, and other times, it’s
                  simply a well-intentioned (albeit ignorant) attempt at
                  drowning out the noise of life. Lorde has gone on to say that
                  the themes of the song have been inspired by the New Age
                  wellness movement of the ’60s, which according to her, is a
                  similar trajectory that the world seems to be heading in now,
                  in terms of spiritual practices.

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some
                    people do not understand why you should have to spend money
                    on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials
                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has
                    the willpower to actually sit through a self-imposed MCSE
                    training.

                <p>
                  The protagonist of the song is a “vapid young woman” who seems
                  to be completely unaware of all the mechanisms she takes part
                  in. This theme of blind participation runs throughout the song
                  and is at the heart of satirical criticism. She instructs her
                  fellow women to “begin sun salutations” and meditations, and
                  although she offers to “get high” and let loose, there is a
                  sense of neuroticism in her agreeing to do it “only if the
                  wind blows just right”. Even while putting on a show of
                  relaxation and flexibility, the woman is high-strung and
                  anxious, refusing to calm down unless the conditions are
                  conducive for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second verse continues in a similar vein when the woman
                  complains about not being able to find what’s wrong with her
                  mood. Despite all her attempts at incorporating meditations
                  and spirituality, she continues to consume “celebrity news”
                  and other information on the Internet. Lorde has been rather
                  vocal this era about the toxicity of online platforms and
                  social media, and the inclusion of this tidbit pokes fun at
                  the woman who is willing to take vitamins and cleanse crystals
                  for her mental health but is unwilling to let go of the
                  Internet, a major cause for anxiety and depression. Later on,
                  she says, “Let’s fly somewhere Eastern, they’ll have what I
                  need”, and it is here that the full context of appropriation
                  is uncovered. Lorde has made it clear that the song does not
                  wish to criticise the protagonist herself, or any other
                  real-life individuals who may partake in similar practices.
                  Instead, it is the wellness industry as a whole that must be
                  blamed for constantly stealing elements from other cultures
                  and white-washing them into a Westernised ideal. The global
                  wellness industry is now worth a whopping 4.2 trillion USD,
                  and this number is only on the rise over the years. Nations in
                  the East are looked to as havens of wellness and spirituality,
                  but instead of appreciating them for such aspects, people have
                  simply been appropriating their rituals without any knowledge
                  about the historical background or intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shaman Durek Verrett, a spiritual guide, has commented on this
                  phenomenon:
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Every person in wellness is taking from the cultures of
                  indigenous people, whether it’s India, Africa, or Indonesia.
                  But the Western world takes these practices and glorifies them
                  into a narcissistic version. You don’t see the Indian,
                  African, Asian or Latino person represented at all.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The satire and ridicule come to a climax in the choruses of
                  the song, where the ignorance of the protagonist is clearly
                  highlighted:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="italic">
                    “I can't feel a thing, I keep looking at my mood ring <br />
                    Tell me how I'm feeling<br />
                    All the sad girls sing, We'll keep dancing 'til the mood
                    rings <br />Tell us how we're feeling”</span
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a slump, the woman is unable to identify her own emotions
                  and instead looks towards a useless plastic ring to tell her
                  how she feels. This introduces an idea that is at the crux of
                  a lot of spirituality; even if we know something to be
                  illogical and incorrect, we look for support from it due to
                  feelings of anxiety and insecurity. It’s for the same reason
                  that several people believe in superstitions or often check
                  their astrological horoscopes. The protagonist in the song is
                  so out of touch with herself that she is forced to seek help
                  from an instrument that she knows to be a scam, and that is
                  the perfect summary for wellness culture today. Spirituality
                  is well and good, but only as long as you know what you’re
                  doing, and why you’re doing it.
