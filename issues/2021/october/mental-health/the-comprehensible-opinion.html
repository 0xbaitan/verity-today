                  Grammy-winning ‘Folklore’, was regarded the most influential
                  album of 2020 with the romance of a lonely witch’s life in a
                  cabin in the woods proving a respite for a world hit too hard
                  with a harsh unimaginable reality. Released on July 24th,
                  2020, Taylor Swift’s eighth studio album is still evoking a
                  worldwide sense of mellow nostalgia and the smell of trees a
                  year later. ‘August’ caressed us with the warm winds and ocean
                  spray of a seaside summer love and ‘Exile’ knocked that wind
                  right out of your stomach leaving you empty and confused about
                  a love that could have been. The appeal of Folklore is not
                  contained in the ingenious songwriting or the compatibility of
                  the music with the theme but in the reality of the themes
                  addressed. They filled the loneliness and the absence of these
                  ubiquitous circumstances while echoing the saturation of all
                  those feelings that the aforementioned circumstances bring.

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some
                    people do not understand why you should have to spend money
                    on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials
                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has
                    the willpower to actually sit through a self-imposed MCSE

                  A song where the subject is singularly pointed out is ‘the
                  last great American dynasty’, inspired by the socialite
                  outcast Rebekah Harkness. The song draws references between
                  Rebekah and Taylor Swift herself, the most tangible link being
                  that she now lives in Holiday House- Rebekah Harkness’ mansion
                  in the 1950s, central to the most lavish gatherings up until
                  her death in 1982. However, once you look past the
                  entertainment that is posed in painting her neighbour’s dog
                  ‘key lime green’, the themes of prejudiced perception shine
                  through. The chorus refers to the public’s notion of her being
                  ‘the maddest woman this town has ever seen’, highlighting
                  their disapproval of her majestic individuality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Rebekah Harkness, the second daughter of prominent stockbroker
                  Allen Tarwater and Rebekah Tarwater, was born in 1915, in St.
                  Louis, Missouri. She attended finishing school at Fermata
                  School for Girls in Aiken, South Carolina, with peers from
                  distinguished families like the Roosevelts and the
                  Auchinclosses. However, she was fairly unaffected by the
                  prestige held in the people in her surroundings and set out to
                  accomplish her goal as recorded in her journal, to ‘do
                  everything bad’. This was an excerpt from the journal of a
                  teenager ridden with angst, anger, and sadness after facing
                  every form of neglect from her parents. She was raised by a
                  nanny who was hired just because of her professional
                  precedence as an employee in a psychiatric institution under
                  the belief that she would be able to ‘cure’ Rebekah’s wild
                  ways. Rebekah would labour endlessly at mastering the art of
                  ballet, eventually falling in love with the art but failing to
                  accomplish her goal to impress her emotionally immovable
                  parents.

                  Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines hysteria as “a
                  psychoneurosis marked by emotional excitability and
                  disturbances of the psychogenic, sensory, vasomotor, and
                  visceral functions”. It is a purely medical term that has its
                  roots in one of the most infuriating philosophies, the
                  doctrines of which have found their way into today’s colloquy
                  and the world’s perception of all Rebekah's. The term hysteria
                  is derived from the Greek word ‘hystera’ which directly
                  translates to ‘uterus’. The inner workings of the uterus were
                  theorized by an array of male philosophers including the famed
                  Plato, Hippocrates, and Aristotle, all of whom believed that
                  the womb was something of an ‘animal alive inside an animal’,
                  causing damage to the fragile female psyche. Known to be the
                  seat for the female mind’s evil, madness, and weakness, it was
                  an imminent threat to the egocentric patriarchal societal
                  structure. Hysterike pnix, meaning hysterical suffocation, was
                  a disease that was said to cause erratic behaviour in women,
                  causing them to rebel and emote strange and vivid outbursts.
                  The medical evidence put forth by Argonauto Melampus to
                  support this theory was that virgins of the Greek city of Argo
                  were insane for refusing to partake in sexual activity and
                  that ‘madness’ festered in their uteruses. Emotions were said
                  to saturate and rot inside the uterus causing emotional
                  outbursts and the only ‘cure’ to this was constant pregnancy
                  to ‘keep the uterus busy’. This was a theory supported by the
                  Greek physician Galen and the French physician Auguste Fabre
                  who believed that all women carried the ‘rotting seeds of
                  hysteria’ within them.
                </p>

                  This theory put forth that a woman who was expressive beyond
                  her faithfulness to any man in her life was ridden with
                  madness and that, unfortunately and repulsively, has seeped
                  its way into today and not as an abstract essence of that
                  theory. A woman, today, in 2021, who so much as shakes her
                  fist while making a point is at a very common risk of being
                  called ‘crazy’ or ‘overdramatic’. A very universally relatable
                  case in point can be found in every heterosexual teen romance
                  featuring an American high school. While two boys wearing
                  letterman jackets getting into a fistfight over a girl is
                  considered cute and protective, two girls getting into a
                  similar fight is a preview to the “walking through the hallway
                  with everyone whispering about the ‘catfight’' montage. This
                  article is not to condone violence, it is to say that the
                  ability to cause it has nothing to do with an empty uterus.
                  Rebekah did not clean her pool with Dom Perignon because she
                  wasn’t pregnant. Whatever her reason may be, she was
                  answerable to no one for spending her fortune and should not
                  have been reprimanded for being a woman living on her terms in
                  luxury. Taylor Swift draws comparisons to herself and the
                  socialite outcast in terms of her public image being tainted
                  from the fight against Scooter Brawn and her old record label,
                  for having relationships that were targeted to quantify her
                  integrity down to writing music as a teenager navigating her
                  way into adulthood under everyone’s microscope. Her ability to
                  defend herself with a steady hand was echoed by the louder
                  screams of those calling her angry, dramatic, and sensitive as
                  though they were the wrong responses to the horrors she faced.

                  “And you’ll poke that bear till her claws come out/ And you
                  find something to wrap your noose around/ And there’s nothing
                  like a mad woman” - Hysteria used to be a medical concept that
                  is not a part of Western medicine. It was exclusive to women
                  because barring witchcraft, it was the only explanation they
                  could think of for a woman being opinionated and knowledgeable
                  of the fact that she was hers and no one else’s. Today,
                  science has come a way long enough to have drawn a clear line
                  between a condition affecting mental health and the simple
                  access to one’s ability to express opinions. The only thing
                  left to do is open our eyes and see which side of it we’re
                  standing on.
