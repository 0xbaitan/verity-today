                  Growing. Changing. Transforming. These are the glowing themes
                  that Franz Kafka’s ‘Metamorphosis’ highlights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This creepy novella by Franz Kafka starts off with a rather
                  unexpected beginning. Gregor Samsa, our MC (Main Character),
                  wakes up as a veined, hard-shelled insect. This saddening
                  story begins by demonstrating the determination that Samsa
                  felt to continue with his human life by trying to get out of
                  bed to go to work until he simply understands that it’s not
                  possible anymore.

                    MCSE boot camps have its supporters and its detractors. Some
                    people do not understand why you should have to spend money
                    on boot camp when you can get the MCSE study materials
                    yourself at a fraction of the camp price. However, who has
                    the willpower to actually sit through a self-imposed MCSE
                    training.

                  Throughout the story, Gregor is a surprising character filled
                  with personality. It’s been speculated that Gregor was facing
                  mental health problems as even though he’d woken up as a bug,
                  a shocking change to any, the root cause of his sadness and
                  his dejected mood was the gloomy weather alongside his
                  inability to attend work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Samsa’s relationship with his work is toxic. He overworks
                  himself regularly at a job he despises alongside a boss he
                  resents. However, the burden and pressure that Gregor and his
                  family have placed upon him to be the sole breadwinner and to
                  help his family live comfortably, bars him from ever trying to
                  contemplate leaving his work, let alone actually going through
                  with the action. This displays how overworked and machine-like
                  Samsa was treated when it came to financial situations and
                  work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon the family’s discovery of Gregor’s transformation, their
                  primary feelings and thoughts are centred around disgust
                  and/or shock at his transformation, and how their financial
                  situation would be impacted due to Samsa’s condition. The lack
                  of familial support, love, and care would’ve contributed to
                  and heightened Samsa’s feelings of depression, pressure,
                  worthlessness etc. Samsa’s family decided to lock and keep him
                  in his room as he served no purpose to them any longer, and
                  eventually ended all sorts of communication and interaction
                  with him due to tenants living in neighbouring rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Grete, Gregor’s sister, attempts to keep him as happy as he
                  can be in his state by feeding him and clearing space for him,
                  however, she eventually grows tired. The emotional stress of
                  seeing her beloved brother in such a position and the burden
                  of continuing to help him grows within her which eventually
                  leads to her suggesting the decision of getting rid of Gregor
                  to her parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gregor’s family does not need much convincing to agree upon
                  the plan of eliminating him as he serves no purpose to them
                  anymore. His transformation had supposedly made him worthless.
                  They’d all taken on jobs and had a stable flow of income so
                  they’d lost use for him. Taking care of him for him to serve
                  no purpose was seen as futile and tiresome by the family
                  therefore, they slowly and quietly pushed him towards his
                  demise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the novella, Grete and her parents all go out
                  for a ‘deserved’ walk through the park as they ponder their
                  daughter’s newfound independence and her future marriage. An
                  ideal happy ending.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘Metamorphosis’ by Franz Kafka centres around Gregor Samsa,
                  who throughout his entire life and specifically during this
                  period, had been treated as if everything that went wrong was
                  his fault. With the constant shifting of blame, ashamed looks,
                  and eventually locking Gregor away and letting him slowly pass
                  away in his room just as they’d found him, his family found
                  peace. Peace within the removal of a tiresome and worthless
                  extra.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Growing and changing are experiences. Experiences that
                  everyone encounters repeatedly throughout their lives. Some
                  drastically, some with more subtlety. However, it is
                  absolutely crucial that we find the beauty in the little and
                  big changes and learn to love and embrace them with everything
                  we have. Embracing the new and improved versions of ourselves.
                  Embracing renaissance, regeneration, and rebirth.
