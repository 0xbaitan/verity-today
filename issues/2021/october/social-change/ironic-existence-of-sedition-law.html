                <p>
                  The question often arises, "Why is India using the same law
                  that the British used to curb the voices of our freedom
                  fighters, to suppress criticism or to eliminate national
                  threat?” To answer this question, we must go over the
                  provisions of the law, its origin, use/misuse, interpretation
                  and precedents.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Section 124 A. of the Indian Penal Code states the Sedition
                  Law of India, and says, "Whoever by word, either spoken or
                  written, or representation, by signs, visible or otherwise,
                  brings an attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or
                  exciter on attempts to excite disaffection towards the
                  Government established by law in India, shall be punished with
                  imprisonment for life, to which fine may be added, or with
                  imprisonment to which may extend to three fine may be added,
                  or with fine."
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sedition is a cognizable offence, which means, a police
                  officer has the authority to make an arrest without a warrant,
                  and to start an investigation with or without the permission
                  of the court. Such offences are grave because they are
                  non-compoundable offences, that is, the accused is not allowed
                  to be freed with some settlement. It is the "state" that files
                  the case, so the question of settlement does not arise. Under
                  sedition, the granting of bail cannot be claimed as a matter
                  of right;it is a matter of discretion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A very important factor in the incorporation of Section 124A
                  in the IPC is the suggestion of James Fitzwilliam Stephen. He
                  provided five specific heads to the crime of sedition:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (1) To excite disaffection against the King, Government or
                  Constitution, or against Parliament or the Administration of
                  Justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (2) To promote, by unlawful means, any alteration in church or
                  the state.
                </p>
                <p>(3) To incite a disturbance of the peace.</p>
                <p>(4) To raise discontent among the King's subjects.</p>
                <p>(5) To excite class hatred.</p>
                <p>
                  Stephen's version is a much broader definition than that
                  provided in section 124A. The latter limits sedition to
                  exciting disaffection towards the Government established by
                  law, which is only a part of the first item on Stephen’s list.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any law is not only limited to its provisions, but also its
                  application and interpretation. Therefore, it is important to
                  understand past case judgments around Section 124A. The
                  Allahabad High Court declared the sedition law void, and the
                  Punjab High Court struck down the law, but in 1962, a Supreme
                  Court judgment brought back the law, justifying that it only
                  applies if there is "incitement to violence."
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Tara Singh Gopi Chand vs. the State, the judgment said that
                  there can be no dispute that Section 124 A is a restriction on
                  the freedom of speech and expression which is guaranteed to
                  all citizens by Clause (1) of Article 19 of the Constitution.
                  The question is whether the section is redeemed by Clause (2).
                  India is a sovereign democratic state; governments may resign
                  and be caused to step down without the foundations of the
                  state being impaired. A law of sedition established during the
                  period of foreign rule has become inappropriate by the very
                  nature of the change which has come about. The only conclusion
                  must be that Section 124A of the Penal Code has become void in
                  contravening the right to freedom of speech and expression
                  guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The right to spread disaffection against the Government or any
                  other person is included in the right to freedom of speech and
                  expression guaranteed by the constitution; if Article 19 (1)
                  (a) did not exist, one could not say that an Indian has the
                  right to spread disaffection against the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the courts of India think that the law should only be
                  limited to incitement of violence , the use of the law by law
                  enforcement agencies shows otherwise. From 2016 to 2019, the
                  number of cases filed against Section 124A of the Indian Penal
                  Code increased by 160 % according to the data provided by the
                  National Crime Record Bureau.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As per the NCRB report, among the cases under trial,
                  twenty-one closed due to insufficient evidence and six were
                  found to be dismissed as Civil cases. Out of 96 cases under
                  sedition charges in 2019, only two men have actually been
                  convicted. The Supreme Court has asked law enforcement
                  agencies on numerous occasions to not misuse IPC Section 124 A
                  to curb freedom of speech and expression, and has directed the
                  state to follow guidelines provided in the Kedarnath vs. State
                  of Bihar trial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The irony here is that while the Indian government is misusing
                  the section of 124A IPC which was brought in by the British to
                  curb dissent by their ancestors in the colonial era, the
                  United Kingdom itself has abolished the law. In 1977, the Law
                  Commission said that the law is redundant, and that it is not
                  necessary to have any offence of sedition. The law commission
                  recommended the common law offence if sedition in England and
                  Wales be abolished. Sedition was abolished in England, Wales,
                  and Northern Ireland by Section 73 of the Coroners and Justice
                  Act 2009, and in Scotland by Section 51 of Criminal Justice
                  and Licensing Act of 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                  India is the world's largest democracy, and like any other, it
                  is necessary to have criticism and dialogue in order to keep
                  the spirit of democracy alive. The question we addressed was
                  if Section 124A of the Indian Penal falls under the ambit of
                  Article 19 (b) of the Indian Constitution, and my conclusion
                  is that observing the current trend of the use of the sedition
                  law, we have to notice the scope it leaves in its
                  interpretation for misuse and curbing of dissent beyond
                  "reasonable restrictions" of Article 19 (a). We must
                  acknowledge that the crimes of seditious libel, words, and
                  such can be dealt with under general provisions addressing
                  hate speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though the law leaves the door open for the government to
                  curb dissent, in the current scenario it will be unrealistic
                  to imagine the scrapping of Section 124 of the Indian Penal
                  Code. Therefore, a more feasible solution would be as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                  &bull; Mens Rea be incorporated in the Act, which is the
                  person's intention to commit a crime, or the knowledge that
                  one's actions or lack of action would cause a crime to be
                  committed as per the section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &bull; The scope of this section should be widened,
                  incorporating the Constitution of India, Legislatures and
                  Administration of Justice (Judiciary).
                </p>
                <p>
                  &bull; Bridging the odd gap between imprisonment for life,
                  imprisonment which may extend to three years, or fines, by
                  fixing the maximum imprisonment for sedition at seven years of
                  rigorous imprisonment.
