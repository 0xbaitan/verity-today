                <p>
                  Cornered away from the rest of India lie the seven states of
                  Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,
                  Nagaland, and Tripura, collectively known as the north-east
                  region of India. They have, for years, hosted the largest
                  diversity of the indigenous population in India, along with
                  some of Asia’s most radicalised militant societies. However,
                  as my introduction suggests, Northeast India is not only
                  geographically isolated but also socially and politically
                  underreported, leaving the people of these states voiceless
                  and vulnerable. Often, they are the butt of insensitive,
                  racist and derogatory remarks that enforce the marginalisation
                  they have been subjected to for all these years.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A lot of this unrest stems from the fact that the Northeast
                  region was not part of pre-colonial India, and only came to be
                  integrated in the year 1826 with the help of the Treaty of
                  Yandaboo. Owing to the fact that it was initially seen as a
                  buffer zone between India and China, or Burma, military
                  enforcement was deployed and large militarised infrastructure
                  was built. This sidelined the existing tribal communities and
                  their political and social ideologies in order to cater to the
                  nation’s interest, thus ensuing a never-ending conflict.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To retain control over these lands, the government enacted the
                  Armed Force Special Powers Act 1958 or AFSPA which gave
                  authority to the armed forces to arrest, search, or conduct
                  encounters without a warrant, an act which is in effect over
                  certain areas to date and continue to be imposed by the
                  government whenever they feel threatened. This causes the
                  common people to feel like they are losing their autonomy in
                  their own homes, giving birth to infamous armed rebel groups
                  and militant societies, while violence continues to be a part
                  of their everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Meghalaya, one of the first militant organisations was
                  Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), formed in the
                  1980s with the objective of countering the influx of ‘dkhars’
                  or outsiders in their territories. They later split into two
                  separate societies - Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council
                  or HNLC, which represented the Khasi and the Jaintia
                  communities, and Achik National Volunteers Council or ANVC,
                  which stood for the Garo community. The former was headed by
                  Cherishterfiels Thangkhiew as the founding general secretary
                  and was governed by the Khasi political ideology that demanded
                  independence from India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thangkhiew died in a police operation on August 18th, 2021,
                  which sparked violence in the state, resulting in the
                  deployment of central armed forces, a curfew, and even the
                  suspension of internet services. The Meghalaya police claim
                  that he had become active in the last six months of his life
                  after years of dormancy, and that they hold proof of his
                  contributions in the low-intensity blasts that occurred in
                  East Jaintia Hills in July, and in Shillong in early August.
                  Additionally, they allegedly received a tip that Thangkhiew
                  was planning another blast and decided to act on it before any
                  further violence could take place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The police define the incidents as such - Thangkhiew tried to
                  escape the police by attacking them with a knife, and in
                  defence the police had to shoot him, causing his death. On the
                  other hand, the local residents believe that this was a
                  fabrication, and his own family accuse the police of murder.
                  Demands for his justice have taken the city by storm with more
                  than hundreds of people forming a funeral procession, while
                  other groups put up banners of a “black flag day”. However,
                  not all that followed Thangkhiew’s death was peaceful, as the
                  city of Shillong became wrecked by vandalism, arson, and
                  pelting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While this might portray public support for the cause of HNCL,
                  what is happening goes much deeper. The citizens are exhausted
                  from being the sacrificial lambs for the gain of the state
                  government. Their plights have been ignored during the
                  lockdown, while illegal resource extraction seems to be
                  carrying on. This, along with the “encounter” as they believe
                  it happened, turned the militant leader into a vigilante, and
                  what the people demand justice for is much greater than one
                  death - they want to be free from being sidelined as puppets
                  in their own land, and they want justice for the extortion
                  that they are facing. They want representation. They want
                  acceptance. And above all, they want to own their land, and
                  not live in fear of the next authoritarian development they
                  will be subjected to.

                    exercise my voice. And, when I am not religiously hoarding
                    playlists or reading a book, you can find me writing in a
