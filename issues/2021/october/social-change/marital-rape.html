                <p>
                  <span class="bold"> TW: mention of r*pe </span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  With reference to Exodus 20:17 which states, and I quote, "You
                  shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet
                  your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox
                  or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor".
                </p>

                <p>
                  This can be used as clear evidence, as mentioned by Robert
                  Kawashima, of how women have been legally labelled as objects
                  belonging to men since they're on the list of "things" that
                  people shouldn't covet, with homes and servants along with
                  them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Robert told VICE: "The basic shocking principle in my view is
                  that women were seen as a type of property". The ancients did
                  not have a proper legally-binding law against forcible rape,
                  but presented either the husband or father of the deceased
                  victim as a victim of the same case. In the ancient Babylonian
                  code of Hammurabi, women did not have a separate social
                  status; the only one allotted to them was in relation to men,
                  that is, their father or husband. Under the very first laws of
                  rape, the rape of a virgin was liable to a death sentence,
                  whereby the survivor was not to be blamed, but when a married
                  woman was raped, both survivor and the guilty were punished by
                  drowning, and blamed equally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, the man was shown as the victim of the case, and then
                  the married woman was blamed for the misfortune of such a
                  dreadful event. The Manusmriti imposes several restrictions
                  upon the activities of women in public, one of which prohibits
                  a married woman from speaking to other men or meeting them
                  without the presence of a responsible male family member. This
                  is allegedly to protect them from other men in light of
                  temptations or sexual advances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This provides evidence that men have not been taught to
                  control their sexual desires from the beginning of time, but
                  have made sure with biased laws and regulations that women may
                  be dominated and oppressed throughout the course of her life.
                  Unlike women, men weren't bound to not seek sexual pleasure
                  outside of their own marriage. In such cases they would only
                  require mutual consent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However,there were no laws against the men who violated their
                  wife's consent, because rape was apparently not possible in a
                  marriage, where the wife is portrayed as an object belonging
                  to the husband and not as a separate identity. In the Laws
                  written in the 11th and 12th century, where rape appeared not
                  as a property crime but a violent crime against an individual,
                  the exception of men raping their own women still existed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the words of Sir Matthew Hale, a notable English barrister
                  of the 17th century, "the husband cannot be guilty of the rape
                  committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual
                  matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up
                  herself in this kind into her husband, which she cannot
                  retract." In simple words, Hale sought women to be a man's
                  property.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With rape beginning to be perceived as a threat to women
                  outside of the household, the Indian Penal Code of 1860 was
                  drafted, stating the exceptions to Section 375 (which deals
                  with rape), "Sexual Intercourse by a man with his own wife who
                  is above the age of 18, is not sexual assault".
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, we have fortunately seen certain progressive changes
                  in the law:
                </p>
                <p>
                  (i) Second amendment of The Criminal Law, 1983 - whoever,
                  being the husband or relative of the husband of a woman,
                  subjects such women to cruelty shall be punished with
                  imprisonment, wherein the word "cruelty" refers to any wilful
                  conduct of a nature which would drive the woman to commit
                  self-harm or cause grave injury or danger of life, limb or
                  health (mental or physical) of the woman and harassment of
                  woman. (ii) Amendment to India Evidence Act, 2002 - provided
                  that in a prosecution of rape or attempt to commit rape it
                  shall not be permissible to put questions in the cross
                  examination of the prosecutrix as to her general immoral
                  character. (iii) Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
                  Act, 2012 - provides protection of children from offenses of
                  sexual assaults, sexual harassment and pornography while
                  safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage. (iv)
                  Criminal Law Act, 2013- provides punishment against sex
                  crimes, redefines rape and made punishments more stringent
                  including death for repeat rape offenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, in 2018, the court heard petitions filed by the NGO
                  RIT Foundation and All India Democratic Women’s Association
                  challenging the constitutionality of The Indian Penal Code
                  1980, section 375, and claiming that it discriminates against
                  married women. While the Delhi HC agreed to examine the issues
                  raised by advocate Karuna Nundy, the Delhi government claimed
                  that striking off the exception would be an offense. The
                  Centre stated that it would lead to the destabilisation of the
                  institution of marriage, and become an easy tool for harassing
                  husbands.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This notion hearkens back to the idea that a woman is nothing
                  but a man's object after marriage, as well as his sexual
                  property. Through various sources of entertainment, TV shows
                  and documentaries, we are presented with the idea that the
                  threat of rape solely originates outsold the household. Sexual
                  Consent is the fundamental right of any woman, yet in India,
                  the law protectors continue to uphold a man's right to rape
                  his wife.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, all hope is not lost, as a division bench of the
                  Kerala High Court declared marital rape to be a ground for
                  divorce .The purpose of feminist movements against the marital
                  rape law is not only to scrape off the outdated mindset of
                  perceiving a woman as a property of her husband, but also
                  fighting to view women as individuals of their own entities.
                  It is about challenging the larger rape culture which denies
                  our mothers, sisters, daughters and wives the basic rights,
                  respect and consent.
