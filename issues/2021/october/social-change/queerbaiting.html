                <p>
                  Queerbaiting is a marketing technique used by artists or
                  creative editors to hint at the assumed queerness of a
                  particular character. It is aimed at attracting the queer
                  audience but does not actually depict any positive LGBTQ+
                  representation. It is a tactic used by artists to appeal to
                  the masses and coerce the LGBTQ+ community into consuming any
                  product by feigning inclusivity and solidarity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To a large number of people, the very existence of
                  queerbaiting is more a positive sign of progress than a
                  problem. The fact that it is even an issue with the queer
                  audience can apparently be taken as a sign of improvement
                  because “producers would not be accused of queerbaiting in the
                  first place if LGBTQ+ representation had not progressed” and
                  “ten to fifteen years ago, even this representation would have
                  been a victory for queer people.” However, the difference
                  between then and now is that the queer audience is no longer
                  desperate for unreal hints at one’s supposed, possible
                  queerness. Queerbaiting cannot be considered any
                  representation at all, only a capitalist marketing ploy which
                  appropriates queer culture for popularity. When we talk about
                  queerbaiting on television, the problem is not a character
                  being confused about their sexuality or not being prepared to
                  ‘come out’. The problem occurs when a character’s
                  almost-queerness becomes the makers’ calculated strategy to
                  misleadingly attract the queer audience without actually
                  satisfying any of their expectations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Storylines that have been accused of queerbaiting include
                  Betty and Veronica’s relationship from the popular teen drama
                  Riverdale, where the audience expected some queer development
                  in the story after they kissed, and not for them to go back to
                  their happy heterosexual relationships. Dumbledore and
                  Grindelwald’s relationship from the Harry Potter series has
                  often been cited as an example of queerness since this
                  development regarding Dumbledore’s sexuality was addressed by
                  the author, J.K. Rowling, much later and it didn’t create any
                  representation or even any changes in the actual story. The
                  popular ship Destiel from the television series Supernatural
                  is also considered to be a well-known instance of queerbaiting
                  where the interactions between Dean Winchester and Castiel are
                  consistently suggestive of sexual attraction and hint at a
                  same-sex relationship, but fail to deliver any real
                  representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What many people might wonder is: how is queerbaiting really
                  harmful? Even if it doesn’t confirm a character’s queerness,
                  it shows something, and that’s better than nothing, right?
                  Well, not really. Imagine a closeted teenager having feelings
                  they are unsure about, which they have been taught aren’t
                  natural. To a person in this scenario who is looking for
                  something to validate the reality and normalcy of their
                  feelings, watching a relationship on-screen that reflects
                  their feelings but isn’t actually queer only makes them
                  believe that their feelings aren’t real and valid either. The
                  relief this person would feel for even a moment is invalidated
                  the moment the character on-screen becomes heterosexual and
                  cisgender as a marketing ploy, and not a reflection of a real
                  queer person. Imagine someone out and proud, reading something
                  because it’s been advertised to trick that person into
                  believing this includes real representation. This person reads
                  about a character they believe is a part of their own
                  community and finds comfort in the fact that someone has taken
                  care to represent them, only to find said character settling
                  in a happy heterosexual relationship with no further mention
                  made of this possible queerness. This furthers their feeling
                  of being alone and makes this person, along with thousands of
                  other queer people, realise that this character was not queer
                  at all, only part of a gratuitous storyline that tricks us
                  into feeling invested. A little queer experimentation, done
                  and dusted, and that’s really all the representation offered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only does queerbaiting negatively impact the queer massses
                  who are trying to find reflections of themselves and their
                  community in media, it also makes it seem to the rest of the
                  world that queerness cannot really be portrayed correctly in
                  most media, even in 2021. Queer representation has almost
                  always been inadequate and inaccurate in popular culture. In
                  such a case, queerbaiting only furthers the idea that
                  queerness is a ‘phase’ or a ‘special case’. By calling
                  queerbaiting ‘queer representation’, we put them in the same
                  group as media that is actually real enough to address
                  queerness satisfactorily. This tactic furthers the idea that
                  heteronormativity is more ‘acceptable’ and more profitable
                  which becomes a hindrance to media actually attempting to
                  normalise queerness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People fought for the right to identify with their sexuality
                  and continue to do so. Even the more privileged of us in the
                  community are aware of living in a society that continues to
                  work against us and to deprive us of very basic human rights.
                  Queerness is the ground reality of several people and to
                  sacrifice that representation to earn higher profits does a
                  huge disservice to the queer people and the queer community
                  who had to work a lot harder than most to achieve the bare
                  minimum of human rights.

                    My name is Priyanka Banerjee (she/her) and I'm a student of
                    class ten in La Martiniere for Girls. When I'm not writing
                    angry articles about our messy world, I like re-watching
                    period dramas and Grey's Anatomy. I joined Verity because of
                    the platform it's provided me with to speak up and raise
                    awareness. Hit me up if you're interested in fun facts about
