                  Emily sat by the window of her childhood home, The Homestead,
                  scribbling away about a life that she did not know, one that
                  she could not achieve from travelling the seas or picket
                  fences, both of which she had access to. She looked out the
                  window at the flowers and trees she so dearly learnt about in
                  botany reminiscing over Sarah, Eliza, Emeline, Harriet and
                  Susan, whom she would cherish in her art like pressed flowers
                  in old pages of lines highlighted and margins scrawled.
                  Looking into her life through that very window, she never
                  lived in this world in the first place. Her world had one
                  gateway, one road and one destination- death and the air
                  smelled of strife and love. She was so consumed with the
                  beauty and the realism in the concept of mortality that she
                  wrote her life into it and around it.

                  Today, a hundred and thirty-five years after greeting the
                  friend she longed to know most about, we forget that Emily
                  Dickinson, before an established poet, was a person. She was a
                  daughter, a sister, a friend and an adversary to the mundane
                  cycle of life and death. She cared for those in her vicinity
                  and she gathered the knowledge and kindled the passion that
                  set fire to all that she thought humanity felt. More than
                  that, she destroyed what she thought she was to feel. Her link
                  to Death was so strong that despite the fact that she wrote
                  almost 1800 poems in her long lifetime, she only ever
                  published ten titled ones. The rest of the plethora of her
                  poems were published by her sister Lavinia ‘Vinnie’ Dickinson
                  after Emily’s death to be represented by the dates of
                  composition and publication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These poems were the different people inside her mind- a
                  dominating female protagonist, a person in disdain of herself
                  for not being lovesick with a person but with the feared
                  Carriage, a memory and nostalgia, Nobody and a Funeral. She
                  wrote these poems as her own self. She used analogies and
                  words and names that only she would understand because they
                  were not meant for everyone to relate to. They were meant to
                  draw a picture in her head, a picture of the life beyond
                  death, the life before death and the line of death between
                  existence and the lack thereof. These pieces not only
                  articulate how deeply she thought of everything, it was
                  evidence that she was far from the general character of
                  morbidity that has been pinned on her, owing to the most
                  superficial opinion of Death- her protagonist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She loved deeply and she knew the importance of life due to
                  having lived the wonders of it, no matter how confusing and
                  painful they may have been. In a poem she composed in 1858,
                  which was later published in 1914, she writes about a sister
                  she has in her house, referring to Lavinia and “One, a hedge
                  away.” She goes on to describe how she sang a different tune
                  and her hum was still built into their hearts the same way the
                  star she chose for her was etched into the sky. The subject of
                  this poem was Susan Gilbert, her sister-in-law who had become
                  her closest and most fiercely loved friend. She expressed that
                  her friends were more worthy of love and adoration than she
                  herself and that her life belonged to solidarity and
                  solidarity to her. She revels in the gift of recollection and
                  memory and emphasizes on the ‘word that bears a sword’- forgot
                  over and over again because to her, recollecting had to be
                  forgetting, missing had to be merry and mourning had to be gay
                  because only then would the fingers that were writing and
                  collecting her life be worth all the answers she was yet to
                  receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She walked lightly, trying not to let the weight of the world
                  on her shoulders crush the earth beneath her feet. She sat by
                  death, letting her sorrow wash past her onto that ground
                  because death is a silent friend, one who will listen and
                  never look at you like they see only the horror in your mind.
                  They have seen everything everywhere and have never been
                  received with open arms and kind eyes. They look into the
                  terror in the trse, accept the permanence of the past and try
                  to reassure beauty in the indefinite. She found comfort in the
                  idea that Death might be a wandering soul, looking for
                  friends, leading others down their paths only to be sent away
                  with Their head hung low. She looked at the world through
                  Their eyes and saw that the colours she saw herself were not
                  too different. She wrote the circle of her life and the lives
                  of the flowers and bees around her in those colours in hopes
                  that when Death finally knocked on her window, that very
                  window at The Homestead, she would give those words to her sad
                  and lonely friend, smile kindly and let herself be helped onto
                  the Carriage that hold but ourselves and Immortality.
