                  From <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> to The
                  <span class="italic">Twilight Saga</span>, ‘Gothic’ as a genre
                  spans across decades of twisted tales and supernatural
                  occurrences, embedded in the intricacies of the human mind.
                  Immortal protagonists are woven into stories of fantasy and
                  tragedy, and have evolved from ‘damsels in distress’ to
                  headstrong teenagers. In short, Gothic literature employs
                  increasingly fascinating themes to explore the dark side of
                  human existence, and has transformed substantially since its
                  origin.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The word ‘Gothic’, which stems from Germanic tribes of the
                  same name associated with barbaric and primitive connotations,
                  is often used in the context of architecture - conjuring
                  images of sharp arches, billowing buttresses, crumbling
                  cathedrals and cryptic vaults. However, in Literature, the
                  word ‘Gothic’ symbolises an illicit world of the supernatural,
                  often coupled with grotesque, gory images and a
                  romanticised-yet-horrific atmosphere. Gothic literature
                  essentially uses fear and paranoia as the primary mood, with
                  either male villains or femme fatales as the main antagonists.
                  It also often uses supernatural elements like ghosts, spirits,
                  witches or even a manipulated human psyche to emphasise on its
                  protagonist's (mostly pale and thin virgin women)
                  helplessness. Madness and desperation coupled with a certain
                  degree of peculiarity is characteristic of this genre, which
                  includes fictional places and ironically, Gothic style castles
                  as the primary setting.

                  Although several commonplace myths and folklore can be
                  attributed to having typical Gothic characteristics, the
                  formal origin of this genre is credited to Horatio Walpole’s
                  18th Century novel The
                  <span class="italic">Castle of Otranto</span> (1764), which
                  displays a host of Gothic characteristics; from the setting (a
                  haunted mansion) to an ancestral curse - evoking simultaneous
                  feelings of awe and terror. William Beckford’s
                  <span class="italic">Vathek</span> (1786) is another novel
                  which goes a step further by displaying more spine chilling
                  scenes like eternal damnation and the sacrificing of children.
                  <span class="italic">The Mysteries of Udolpho</span> (1794)
                  and <span class="italic">The Italian</span> (1797), both
                  written by Ann Radcliffe, as well as
                  <span class="italic">The Monk</span> by Matthew Lewis explore
                  similar themes that grow more sinister and macabre with every
                  page- a characteristic trait of 18th Century Gothic
                  literature.

                  Some of the most well known pieces of literature of the 19th
                  Century contain distinct gothic undertones as well. Take
                  <span class="italic">Dracula</span>, for example, which
                  includes not only a decrepit, haunting mansion, but a
                  supernatural element which is filtered in through its eerie
                  owner. Written by Abraham Stroker in 1897, the fictional
                  setting of Transylvania, the usage of the art of seduction to
                  lure victims and the unexplained mysterious events gives rise
                  to one of the most classic pieces of Gothic literature in
                  history.

                </div>
                <p>
                  The work of the Bronte sisters, too, can be observed as
                  containing typical Gothic elements, especially Emily Bronte’s
                  iconic novel <span class="italic">Wuthering Heights</span>,
                  which gave us one of the longest standing self-destructive
                  Byronic heroes - in the figure of the tormented Heathcliff.
                  Published in 1847, it deals with the protagonist's inner
                  turmoil of living in a patriarchal society and also outlines
                  haunting descriptions of sickening cruelty. Charles Dickens,
                  despite his much later Victorian politics and known for his
                  bitter commentary on a society post industrial revolution also
                  displays common Gothic characteristics in his book
                  <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> (1837-38), which
                  focused on the urban tale of an impoverished young boy and
                  employed a more subtle manifestation of the genre through the
                  protagonist’s suffering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two other popular names from the genre include
                  <span class="italic"
                    >The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</span
                  >
                  (written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886) and
                  <span class="italic">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span>
                  (written by Oscar Wilde in 1891). While the former is a
                  thriller for the ages and an unmatched exploration of the
                  split personality syndrome, the latter is a spine-chilling
                  reworking of the Faustian legend with deep and abiding queer
                  undertones. The same can be said for Mary Shelley’s
                  <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span> (1818) which has
                  thrived through millions of adaptations and features an
                  outlandish monster born of strange experiments and is a
                  definite bridge between the darker side of the Romantic
                  imagination through the lens of the Gothic.

                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">

                  The 20th Century saw a departure from traditional Gothic
                  characteristics. Novels now revolved around an omnipresent air
                  of mystery and suspense, foregrounded with a tragic romance.
                  The best example of this would be Daphne du Morier’s
                  <span class="italic">Rebecca</span> (1938) which showed the
                  psychological torment of the protagonist when she was trying
                  to live up to the name of her current lover’s dead wife,
                  Rebecca. With romance as one of the main themes, the trademark
                  ghastliness of the human mind in Gothic literature was also
                  highlighted in this book which also gave a modern spin to the
                  trope of the mad woman in the attic from the other standout
                  Gothic romance <span class="italic">Jane Eyre</span> by the
                  eldest of the Bronte sisters.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Some other classic Gothic works of this era include
                  <span class="italic">The Phantom of the Opera</span> (1910) by
                  Gaston Leroux, <span class="italic">The Shining</span> (1977)
                  by Stephen King and
                  <span class="italic">Flowers in the Attic</span> (1979) by V.C
                  Andrews. All of these books contain a nail biting and murky
                  atmosphere drenched in suspense and clouded with a sense of
                  evil.

                  When it comes to the 21st Century, Gothic undertones have
                  become increasingly popular. Take, for instance,
                  <span class="italic">The Book Thief</span> (2005) by Marcus
                  Zusak- it has a distinctly mysterious element throughout it
                  which is expounded by the protagonist’s misery. Despite being
                  the story of a child it has a fascinatingly critical obsession
                  with Death which gets expounded in the novel’s employment of
                  the same figure as the primary narrator. Even in stories like
                  The <span class="italic">The Blind Assassin</span> (2000) by
                  Margaret Atwood, one is exposed to a seemingly normal tale
                  until the layers are stripped and an undeniable, dark
                  repugnance is revealed. Some other popular examples of 21st
                  Century Gothic literature include
                  <span class="italic">No Country for Old Men</span> (2005) by
                  Cormac McCarthy,
                  <span class="italic">The Lovely Bones</span> (2002) by Alice
                  Sebold and <span class="italic">The Twilight Saga</span> (2005
                  to 2020) by Stephanie Mayer. All of these examples have become
                  increasingly significant in pop culture, especially The
                  Twilight Saga, which just goes to show how immortal the Gothic
                  genre has become.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What makes Gothic Literature in general so relevant today is
                  its depiction of the twisted nature of the human mind and its
                  eerie manifestations in the real world. Dark tales of
                  werewolves and vampires are embedded in the folklore of many
                  cultures, and it's through these age-old stories that Gothic
                  Literature has been renewed time and time again. Even today,
                  ‘Gothic’ as a genre has moulded itself to tell new stories
                  through a different lens, and will no doubt continue to evolve
                  and transport readers into a dark world of fantasy for ages to
                  come.

                    caffeine dependent sixteen year old whose hobbies include
                    binge watching trash tv, reading gory thrillers and baking
                    chocolate chip cookies. On an average day, you'll find me
                    clicking five hundred pictures of my dog and starting
                    another book I won't finish.
