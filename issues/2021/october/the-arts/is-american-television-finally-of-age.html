                    beautiful mess but you can’t cling to what was. You have to

                  >

                <p>
                  On 27th March, 2005, the first episode of the first season of
                  Grey’s Anatomy aired in the United States and no one could
                  have imagined that in 2021, over 15 million people in the
                  world would be eagerly waiting for its eighteenth season. This
                  single longest-running primetime medical drama has only gained
                  immense popularity over the last sixteen years, a fact that
                  owes to how well the characters and storylines have evolved
                  with television. The evolution of television over nearly the
                  last two decades can be observed by looking at how this one
                  show that continues to be one of the most popular and loved
                  shows airing on television even today, has changed drastically
                  over time. The demands of viewers of shows as popular as
                  Grey’s Anatomy have changed considerably since 2005 and
                  continue to change rapidly. From introducing the world to the
                  ‘dark and twisty’ intern, Meredith Grey (played by Ellen
                  Pompeo), as she opened up to McDreamy (played by Patrick
                  Dempsey) with the good hair and a secret wife, to showing us
                  issues regarding politics, gender, race and sexuality being
                  addressed realistically on-screen, Grey’s has come a long way,
                  fulfilling popular demands, breaking up our favourite couples,
                  and raising a hue and cry for a variety of socio-political
                  issues.

                <p>
                  The show started sixteen years ago as your everyday medical
                  drama with a white blonde protagonist in love with her boss,
                  Derek Shepherd. It included a predominantly white, cisgender
                  and heterosexual class with a heterosexual romance at the
                  heart of the narrative. However, even though the main content
                  of the show was suited to a medical drama over a decade old,
                  its casting was still more diverse than most primetime shows
                  in 2005. James Pickens Jr., who played the Chief of Surgery,
                  Richard Webber, on the show, said that he had never seen an
                  African-American in such a role before, while the network
                  executives had intended Cristina Yang’s character to be played
                  by a white woman; however, it was made legendary by the
                  Asian-American actor, Sandra Oh. But in spite of including
                  African-Americans and Asian-Americans in its cast, the show
                  was practically colour-blind and hardly addressed any issues
                  regarding race or other socially relevant issues. Nonetheless,
                  its huge commercial success and immense popularity even when
                  it first aired goes to show that its content and casting met
                  the demands of the audience of the time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As the show progressed, its storylines started creating more
                  space for diversity in characters and accurate representation.
                  That the show received little to no backlash for further
                  diversifying its cast and characters and continued to remain
                  one of the most popular shows of all time goes to show how the
                  demands of the viewers were changing over the years. Sara
                  Ramirez’s Calliope Torres became the longest-running queer
                  character in the history of US television and the character’s
                  bisexuality also marked one of the earliest series regular
                  queer rioles on primetime television. Ramirez’s character
                  addressed the conflict that often arises with coming out in a
                  very religious Catholic family as Callie’s family cuts her off
                  and abandons her soon after she reveals her sexuality. With
                  the arrival of Arizona Robbins (played by Jessica Capshaw),
                  television’s longest-running lesbian character, in season five
                  of the series, we also get to see a rare case of a happy queer
                  person on television, filled with warmth and sunshine, and not
                  necessarily going through the stereotypical sexuality crisis.
                  Her arrival also birthed one of the show’s most popular ships,
                  Calzona, which went on to become the longest-running same-sex
                  relationship on network television.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In recent seasons, the show has not only added more diverse
                  characters to its main cast but it has also used its platform
                  to voice the truth about social issues. It has dealt with the
                  American epidemic of drug addiction through the character of
                  Amelia Shepherd, a woman who, despite undeniable talent, is
                  belittled, never taken seriously by her seemingly very
                  accomplished family and constantly made to question herself
                  and her skill. It addressed racism by showing the terror with
                  which people of colour live in the US everyday, particularly
                  highlighting the lack of proper access to healthcare for
                  people of colour in its most recent season which dealt with
                  the Covid-19 crisis and its disproportionate impact on people
                  of colour. The show also addressed the issue of racism and
                  police brutality in season 14 through the story of a young
                  African-American boy who was shot fatally by a police officer
                  for no justifiable reason. In season 18, the show also
                  commented on the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor
                  and its aftermath in terms of the Black Lives Matter (BLM)
                  movement. It focuses on sexism and sexual assault in season
                  15, particularly during the incredibly powerful episode of the
                  story of a woman who was raped in a bar and was too scared to
                  ask for help in fear that she will not get any justice and
                  that her marriage will fall apart as a result. The issue of
                  domestic violence is addressed in the same season through Jo
                  Wilson’s character and her past relationship with a famous but
                  abusive husband whom she had to change her identity to escape
                  from. It also talked about the state of the healthcare system
                  during the COVID-19 pandemic in its last season and the toll
                  the pandemic has taken, not only on doctors all around the
                  world but also on the general population.

                  The first batch of interns, which comprised the main cast of
                  the show, were 80% white and entirely cisgender and
                  heterosexual people. Now, the latest batch of interns includes
                  Grey’s first homosexual man, Levi Schmitt; a transgender
                  person, Casey Parker; a Muslim woman, Dahlia Qadri; and Reza
                  Khan, a vascular surgeon in Pakistan who was forced to repeat
                  his surgical internship after migrating to the US to practice
                  medicine. The Meredith Grey who started off as a doe-eyed
                  intern having an illicit affair has now become one of the most
                  empowered women and one of the best surgeons on the show on
                  her own merit and skill. Moreover, she has evolved into a
                  spokesperson and activist fighting for radical change both
                  within and outside the healthcare system. Going back to watch
                  an episode from season one now shows a distinct change in the
                  content of the show, the casting, the topics at the focus of
                  the show and so on, a change which reflects how the demands of
                  the current generation are very different from what was
                  popular a decade ago. Grey’s Anatomy proves that television
                  series can be popular while simultaneously being politically
                  correct and remaining relevant to its present time, serving an
                  audience which is finally demanding on-screen representation
                  of marginalised communities and addressal of the most basic
                  human rights issues. While the show has always adhered to the
                  demands of the audience to remain one of the most popular
                  television series of all time, it has also always been ahead
                  of its times, not holding on to what was but choosing to look,
                  and fight for, what might be.

                    period dramas and Grey's Anatomy. I joined Verity because of
                    the platform it's provided me with to speak up and raise
                    awareness. Hit me up if you're interested in fun facts about
                    the Mahabharata!
