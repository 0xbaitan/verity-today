                <p>
                  When I was torrenting Akira Kurosawa’s 1984 war film Ran, the
                  movie seemed like an enigmatic feast for the cinephile: the
                  still shots painted it as a majestic masterwork. Now, after I
                  watched it, it was still very much in the proximity of a
                  masterwork, but there was a seismic shift in my perception of
                  the film. All the characters were massively fallible: they
                  were either too proud, too stupid or too devious. Kurosawa had
                  taken characters who honoured themselves to the fullest, and
                  had put them all into a mess characterized by suffering, karma
                  and blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The film is set in the ‘Sengoku’ period in the 16th century,
                  and revolves around ‘Great Lord’ Hidetora Ichimonji and his
                  three sons: Jiro, Taro and Saburo. After a fine hunt on a
                  pleasant day, as his sons and his consigliere’s feast
                  together, Hidetora announces that he will abdicate his throne
                  in favour of his eldest offspring Taro. Jiro accepts this
                  without much thought but Saburo objects - and is banished from
                  the kingdom. While Taro is assumed to be a righteous successor
                  and Jiro a loyal brother, both quickly undergo sleights of
                  heart and betray their father in a desperate civil war to
                  conquer the kingdom. Then follows a war sequence that has gone
                  down in the history of cinema as an iconic blend of colour,
                  conquest and chaos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Great Lord observes heartless bloodshed around himself
                  and is debilitated by the abandonment of his trusted sons, he
                  loses all mental capacity and is soon rendered senile. He
                  wanders through the ridges and plains of an expansive
                  countryside, against the storm, followed by his entertainer
                  and his commander, shouting ‘Where am I?’ and displaying
                  pathological shock at meeting the sons and daughters of those
                  he slaughtered when young. He becomes a true mad-man, a mere
                  puppet of a protagonist. Kurosawa, through the futile
                  movements and sheer shock of the bereaved Great Lord,
                  explicitly reminds the viewers how truly vain and fragile life
                  is, or can be. We all identify ourselves with titles and
                  accomplishments, but they are truly impertinent to what
                  happens when the waves of the stormy sea crash against the
                  abstract rocks of wind we dig into floors of sand - to project
                  ourselves as those worthy of worship and honour. If mountains
                  and cities have become naught, what is a pristine king?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jiro eventually kills Taro and is romanced by the elder’s wife
                  (Lady Kaede, who has a meticulous plan of her own) while
                  already in ‘possession’ of a lady (Lady Sue). A significant
                  background detail to these marriages would be that The ‘Great
                  Lord’ had killed both Lady Sue and Lady Kaede’s royal
                  families, binding them, in the process, to his prodigal sons.
                  These women are indisputably more intrinsic to the turns and
                  toil of this movie than the obvious picks. The viewers are
                  kept glued to the screen more because of the villainous and
                  intriguing character of Lady Kaede and the conflicted
                  interplay between her and Shuri (Jiro’s right-hand man) than
                  Taro and Jiro’s adolescent antiques. She is the heart of the
                  movie’s most engaging dynamics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The more spiritually relevant sub-plot, however, is that of
                  Lady Sue and her blinded brother Tsurumaru. Their parents were
                  slain by Hidetora when they were just children, and they have
                  since become silent, burning victims. Lady Sue embraces the
                  stoicism of Buddha and finds in herself the ability to forgive
                  Hidetora and build peace through her devotion, but for
                  Tsurumaru, it is not as simple as that. In fact, the conflict
                  between unmitigated suffering and the existence of God (or in
                  this case, Buddha’s truths) is Ran’s key question.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But Kurosawa understands that an oblivious affirmation of
                  stoic faith should not be so easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a small diversion from the escape Tsurumaru embarked on
                  with his sister, Lady Sue is beheaded on the orders of Lady
                  Kaede. Her religious devotion eventually culminated in the
                  void, and Kurosawa mercilessly visualizes this in a silent
                  shot of Lady Sue lying beheaded in a situated heap of flowers
                  alongside her dead maid. The last shot of the movie zoom cuts
                  to Tsurumaru, standing on a cliff’s neck, blind, waiting for
                  his dead sister. In trying to walk, he loses hold of the
                  scroll of the Amida Buddha his sister gave him as a symbol of
                  strength, and the camera cuts to the scroll, lying, covered by
                  shadows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thus, Ran raises a spiritual quandary long bemoaned in the
                  history of man: Is it possible to be good in a world with
                  greedy, war-waging men? Hell, is it even desirable to be good
                  if the greedy men are eventually going to execute the good?
                  Hidetora kills, and stands victor to an empire. He steps down
                  gently but is metaphorically stabbed without his sons having
                  any concern for familial, or even humane, morals. Life is
                  deliberately related to loss in this frenzy bloodshed of sin
                  and swords.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The questions above make up a deeply conflicted area for the
                  film: Kurosawa treats both his spiritually sound and
                  intrinsically immoral characters equally woefully. And, in my
                  opinion, with this he consciously or unconsciously clears all
                  bouts of anti-religious commentary apparent in the film. It is
                  a glorious affirmation of the Buddha: this world is a world of
                  suffering and all pleasure is temporal. We all will die
                  someday, and our molecules will arrange themselves into rocks
                  and pillars.

                  What are our choices? Be spiteful and tyrannical as Jiro, and
                  face defeat. Lose everything and blur your conscience like the
                  senile Hidetora, and face a losing negotiation with fate. But
                  you can also welcome the suffering of consciousness and
                  embrace your cosmic shortsightedness like Lady Sue, and die
                  peacefully, for death will come to all sentience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ran stinks of the mess of mankind (narrated along the lines of
                  a Homeric fall, being inspired by Shakespeare’s King Lear):
                  Kurosawa’s characters look upto the clouding sky in search for
                  God, and only in death do they find him. It teaches an
                  endearing lesson, it is nearly impossible to forgive someone
                  who has killed your loved ones, humiliated and beaten you, or
                  stolen your cheerio (and live in devotion to the Buddha). It
                  is a noble ideal. This is not easy. This is not new. That is
                  the point.

                    Boys. I (co-)head and write for the Arts department at
                    Verity Today, and have done so for quite a while now. When
                    I’m not being a pretentious douchebag, I’m ordering books I
                    won’t read and trying to come up with insubstantial
                    personality descriptions. So it goes.
