                <p>
                  The Internet is often a beautiful place, simply because of all
                  the timeless moments of irreverence and innocent indignities
                  that it allows for. Some of my favourite aspects of pop
                  culture are fashion, celebrities, viral memes, and absolute
                  flops that the Twitterati have a field day with. In a twist of
                  fate, each of these came about in a glorious medley of
                  entertainment: Karlie Kloss at the 2019 Met Gala.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Anyone who knows anything about the entertainment industry
                  will immediately know what I am talking about when they hear
                  the buzzwords “Karlie Kloss” and “Met Gala” in conjunction.
                  For the uninitiated, a crash course: the Met Gala is
                  considered the most exclusive social event in the world.
                  Hosted by Vogue, celebrities of a certain stature are invited
                  to attend the party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
                  York, dressed according to a theme fixed for each year. Other
                  than fashion weeks in London, Paris, and Milan, the Met Gala
                  is fashion’s biggest night. In 2019, the theme for the event
                  was “Camp: Notes on Fashion”, referencing the aesthetic of
                  Camp first conceptualised by American essayist Susan Sontag.
                  In brief, Camp is a stylistic sensibility that deals with
                  exaggeration, irony, and theatricality. It’s big, bold, and
                  overstated, and simplicity is not a concept that exists in its
                  vocabulary. As such, the 2019 Gala was extremely looked
                  forward to, as much of the fashion world was expected to turn
                  up in elaborate eleganza.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Cut to the day of the event: Karlie Kloss tweets a dramatic,
                  suspense-filled teaser of her costume for the party, captioned
                  “looking camp right in the eye” (a phrase which, by now, has
                  become a Twitter-favourite). In light of the tweet, there were
                  great expectations for her, until she actually arrived at the
                  event… in the most basic, frankly ugly looking, short gold
                  dress with big black poofy sleeves, serving underwhelming B
                  Barry Benson realness. Needless to say, it was immediately
                  trashed on by the entire internet and was the most
                  talked-about outfit at the event for all the wrong reasons.

                  (better) looks of the year, featuring Janelle Monae, Ezra
                  Miller, and Billy Porter:

                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, that was the
                  last Met Gala for a while, as 2020 did not see the event
                  happening. The 2021 Gala, hence, is one of the most
                  anticipated occasions of the year, to be held in September.
                  Already, great hype has been built around the party, with fake
                  seating arrangements and invitation lists floating around
                  online, but Karlie Kloss’s colossal failure refuses to leave
                  my head. Exacerbated by my recent perusal of Sontag’s original
                  essay on Camp, a hypothesis gradually formed over the past few
                  weeks: yes, it may have been hated on, and yes, it was a
                  hideous dress, but was Karlie Kloss actually Camp all along?
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to properly analyse the concept of Camp and which
                  stylistic choices apply to it, I shall be using Sontag’s essay
                  as my Holy Grail, during the course of which she outlines the
                  different properties and components of Camp. A major topic
                  covered by the essayist in her piece is that of the “Camp
                  vision”. Essentially, Camp, or any other aesthetic for that
                  matter, is defined not only by the creator or the wearer but
                  the beholder as well. It is the audience’s vision that largely
                  dictates whether or not a piece of clothing is Camp, and
                  hence, it is not in the context of the intentions of the
                  wearer (Kloss) that we must analyse the outfit, but in the
                  opinions and reception of the viewer (the press and the
                  Internet).
                </p>

                <p>
                  There is one principle that is central to my argument, which
                  is at the very core of Camp itself:
                </p>

                <p>
                  “The ultimate Camp statement: it’s good because it’s awful.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  With this principle in mind, the Camp-ness of Kloss’ outfit is
                  only too outfit. In failing entirely at meeting expectations
                  and in failing at meeting the traditional qualities of
                  exaggerated and theatrical Camp, Kloss’ outfit is so awful
                  that, paradoxically, it becomes Camp. It is the very lack of
                  Camp that makes it Camp, and that is the complexity of
                  aesthetics and style in the postmodern era. Additionally,
                  Sontag states that “the pure examples of Camp are
                  unintentional; they are dead serious”. The seriousness with
                  which Kloss took her outfit is easily seen in the dramatic
                  buildup to her reveal; she did not expect to become the butt
                  of a viral joke. Pure, naive Camp is never deliberate but
                  takes itself as seriously as possible. “Intending to be Campy
                  is always harmful”, says Sontag, but that is where the
                  perspective of the viewer, as the holder of the Camp vision,
                  comes in. It cannot be denied that most of the audience never
                  intended Kloss’ outfit to be Camp- the years of memes and
                  jokes are testament to that fact. But once again, perhaps that
                  is exactly why it is Camp after all. The innocence attached
                  with dismissing something as not being Camp inundated it with
                  the primary qualities of being Camp in the first place. To
                  even get a little carried away, some might say that the
                  ultimate Camp statement is to simply not be Camp.
                </p>

                <p>
                  An extract from the essay reads, “There is a sense in which it
                  is correct to say: ‘It’s too good to be Camp.’” Unfortunately,
                  for Karlie, the opposite is only too true; the dress is
                  unshapely and made of an unappealing fabric, and the puffy
                  sleeves only detract even more from the costume. Camp is the
                  “love of the ‘off’, of things-being-what-they-are-not”. One
                  could easily argue that in refusing to hold up to great
                  expectations of extravaganza, her outfit easily meets all
                  these conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Can Karlie be redeemed then, and can her dress be called Camp
                  after all? Not quite yet, because another primary feature of
                  the sensibility is that of aesthetic quality, a much more
                  subjective parameter than the more objective features
                  discussed before. Most people (including me) agree that the
                  outfit barely had any stylistic advantages, with an odd cut
                  ending far above the knee and the crinkly folds that looked
                  like cheap gift wrap. In my opinion, though, it does have a
                  certain Campiness to it, in terms of how awful it looks.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The verdict? It’s Camp. That, however, does not take away from
                  the hilarity of the fact that Karlie Kloss completely failed
                  at what she originally tried to do. In retrospect, though, was
                  she any worse than the multitudes of men who turn up every
                  year in the bare minimum, wearing a bland tuxedo that is
                  invariably blue or black and pale in comparison to the real
                  effort put into the women’s outfits? Absolutely not.
