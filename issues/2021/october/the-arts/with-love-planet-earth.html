                <p>
                  Humanity has major trouble accepting the sheer vastness of the
                  universe. In our fleeting lives, we remain so obsessed with
                  ourselves and our admirations and discriminations, seldom do
                  we truly understand how small and insignificant we are in the
                  grand scale of things. This insignificance doesn’t have to be
                  a grave injustice though, I say as I try to convince myself
                  that failing Physics will not affect my life in any way. It is
                  sometimes when that insignificance, desperation, and
                  loneliness truly, truly settles itself into our bones for
                  moments, minutes, hours, even entire lifetimes at a time, do
                  we get gratuitous attempts at being remembered beyond our
                  extinction. The Golden Records attached to the Voyager
                  Spacecrafts I and II are perhaps the greatest examples of
                  such.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In 1977, NASA launched Voyager I and II Spacecrafts with
                  various, ambitious objectives. Voyager II’s objective was to
                  fly by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and it has done
                  its job immensely well. Voyager I on the other hand was made
                  to focus only on Jupiter and Saturn, helping in the discovery
                  of five new moons of Saturn, two Jovian moons, and rings
                  around both Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager I became the first
                  human spacecraft to venture into interstellar space, and it’s
                  estimated that transmissions from either spacecraft will cease
                  to continue after 2030. That is to say, our Voyagers are never
                  coming home.
                </p>

                <div class="feature-img space-top-bottom-3">
                  <img
                    class="img-fluid"
                    src="/articles/2021/october/the-arts/with-love-planet-earth/IMG2.jpg"
                    alt=""
                  />
                </div>

                <p>
                  What they carry though, as they venture further and further
                  away from us, straying away from the warmth of the sun, into
                  an empty void that stretches on and on, is far more crucial to
                  our faith, and everything we have ever achieved--they carry
                  the Golden records, which if found, would introduce humanity
                  in a way we have been craving for so long.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Golden records are constructed of gold-plated copper and
                  are 30 cm in diameter. Protecting the cover is Uranium-238,
                  which has a durability of 4.468 billion years. Thus, the
                  records will not endure any destruction for about 4 billion
                  years. But will humanity last as long for extraterrestrials to
                  obtain the record, decipher it, and be greeted by a
                  civilization that lost, and fought, and loved so hard, that it
                  almost destroyed itself? Will we even exist to receive the
                  confirmation after centuries of wonder and curiosity that
                  we’re not the only ones living and thinking?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The chance isn’t even narrow, it’s near impossible. We thus
                  conclude that long after humanity goes extinct, whether it be
                  with a scream or a whisper, the only proof of our existence
                  will remain trapped in the form of waves, on a disc, attached
                  to two lonely Voyagers who drift further away from their home,
                  waiting, hoping, that someone discovers the veiled evidence of
                  humanity and it’s wonderful, terrifying existence.
                </p>

                <p>How do you sum up life on earth though?</p>

                <p>
                  The solution is to remind ourselves what we truly are, what
                  matters and what does not, what defines us collectively rather
                  than our intricate journals filled with a being that will
                  probably not make a mark in the history of anything, but they
                  still live, thrive and die. We’re nothing but pawns of a game
                  that decides its own destiny, but ambition, hope, and
                  stubbornness are also inherently human qualities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The record is a culmination of audio, visual, and brainwaves
                  detailing life on Earth. First comes the audio. It contains
                  greetings in 55 languages from all over the world, all of them
                  either wishing for peace in the universe, describing who we
                  are and what planet we inhabit. In some cases, we wish
                  ‘welcome home’ to whoever is listening. Maybe we expect them
                  to be alone, maybe it’s dedicated to our very own Voyagers,
                  maybe it’s our way of introducing what a ‘home’ is to them.
                  The next section is composed of sounds. Sounds of thunder,
                  lightning, and storms. Of birds, whales, and wind. Of
                  laughter, footsteps, heartbeats, and dogs. Then there is
                  music. Folk and rock, Beethoven and Bach. Songs sung at
                  weddings, and songs that scream loneliness. There is music
                  from various different languages, and it all culminates to
                  show that we’re all singing in our own distinct voices,
                  languages, and situations, but we’re singing nonetheless.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next, there are images. Images detailing our solar system,
                  metric systems, cells, and human anatomy. There are families,
                  children, mothers, fathers. Leaves falling in autumn, valleys,
                  rivers, and many more pictures that boast the beauty of our
                  home. Then come the more mundane things. Black and white
                  athletes running, traffic in India caused almost single
                  handedly by auto-rickshaws, an astronaut in space, a woman
                  smiling at the camera whilst eating in a supermarket, a
                  picture detailing eating and drinking, children crowded around
                  a humongous globe. These are obscure pictures that we find
                  whilst looking through a photo album and laugh recalling the
                  memories of a time long left behind. Maybe that is us at our
                  greatest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The most fascinating part of the Golden records is perhaps the
                  hour-long recording of the brainwaves of Ann Duryan. Ann
                  Duryan thought of many things. She thought of our history and
                  glory but she also thought of our misery and violence, to
                  ultimately present how paradoxical, good and bad our
                  civilization is. But right at the end, she thought of love.
                  She managed to conceal our greatest achievement in that disc
                  that will carry humanity’s memory.

                  we stood, but throughout it all, there was always love, love,

                    Hi! I'm Sreemita Mukherjee (she/her), a student of class ten
                    at La Martiniere for Girls. When I'm not writing wishful
                    articles about art and history and romanticizing every
                    particle on god's green earth, you'll find me obsessing over
                    minecraft role-plays and Mitski lyrics. Hit me up if you
                    want to know the most obscure facts about rural Japan!
