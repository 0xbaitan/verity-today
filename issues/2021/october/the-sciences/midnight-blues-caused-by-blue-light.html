                  Sleep. Can't live without it, and for some reason, can't get
                  it. But why? Well, it has all got to do with your pre-bedtime
                  ritual. Do you, by any chance, use your phone before bed?
                  Maybe your laptop? Well, the blue light they emit, the one
                  that allows you to see your screen in high resolution,
                  actually has several negative effects on your brain and
                  therefore, your sleep quality.
                </p>

                <p class="heading">But what is Blue light?</p>

                <p>
                  Blue light is one of the several coloured lights displayed in
                  a visible light spectrum. The other colours in the spectrum
                  include red, purple, and yellow, amongst others. All the
                  colours in this spectrum are emitted at different wavelengths
                  and energy levels; blue light has shorter wavelengths and
                  higher energy than other colours. Some research shows a link
                  between eye damage and short-wave blue light with wavelengths
                  between 415 and 455 nanometers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Blue light tends to trick our brains into thinking it is still
                  daytime. As a result, our brains are hardwired to stay awake
                  and try to be productive. This happens because as our brain
                  thinks itâ€™s daytime, the sleep hormone, melatonin, isn't
                  released. Melatonin secretion begins a few hours before
                  bedtime, and that is why a set bedtime and a proper night
                  routine are highly encouraged, such that the release of
                  melatonin is on time every night and there isn't any
                  obstruction to the secretion. The darkness of the night and a
                  relaxing routine help increase the melatonin hormone, but the
                  blue light only reduces it, if not stopping it altogether.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Teenagers are more sensitive to the effects of blue light than
                  adults. Therefore, you are more likely to move around after
                  the usual bedtime. Coupled with other things that make it
                  difficult for us to fall asleep, such as the biological clock
                  that makes us feel awake at night, more homework and
                  distractions, and early school hours, teens usually do not get
                  the amount of sleep they require.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Researchers at Harvard University conducted an experiment
                  comparing the effects of exposure to blue light for 6.5 hours
                  with exposure to green light of a comparable brightness. Blue
                  light inhibits melatonin for about twice as long as green
                  light, and the circadian rhythm changes twice as long as green
                  light (3 hours vs. 1.5 hours). In another blue light study,
                  researchers at the University of Toronto compared melatonin
                  levels in people exposed to bright indoor light and wearing
                  anti-blue light glasses with people exposed to dim light but
                  not wearing glasses. The fact that the hormone levels in the
                  two groups are roughly the same supports the hypothesis that
                  blue light is an effective melatonin inhibitor. It also shows
                  that if shift workers and night owls wear glasses that block
                  blue light, they could protect themselves. Cheap sunglasses
                  with orange lenses block blue light, but they also block other
                  colours, so they are not suitable for indoor use at night.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Projection time (especially at night) is related to lack of
                  sleep. The blue light emitted by electronic devices can
                  interfere with our circadian rhythms or sleep cycles. In one
                  study, exposure to blue light for just 2 hours at night
                  reduced or stopped the release of the sleep hormone melatonin.
                  Turning off the power to the digital device at least 3 hours
                  before bed may help.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Furthermore, exposure to blue light can even increase your
                  risk of certain cancers. One study found that people who work
                  night shifts have an increased risk of breast, prostate and
                  colorectal cancer.
                </p>

                <p class="heading">What about children?</p>

                <p>
                  A child's eyes are unable to filter blue light as well as
                  older individuals. Too much information gleaned from the
                  device screen can increase the childâ€™s chances of obesity,
                  myopia, and poor concentration. At night, it can cause the
                  body to release melatonin more slowly than adults. To protect
                  their eyes, the child's screen display time should be limited.
                  They should be asked to put away all electronic equipment,
                  including portable gaming devices, at least half an hour
                  before going to bed.
                </p>
                <p class="heading">
                  Why do you get sad right before falling asleep?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In animal studies, nighttime exposure to blue light is
                  associated with symptoms of depression. But exposure to blue
                  light during the day can have the opposite effect. It has been
                  used to treat seasonal affective disorder or SAD. This is a
                  type of depression related to seasonal changes. Studies have
                  shown that exposure to blue light for 20 minutes in the
                  morning can help relieve SAD symptoms.
                </p>
                <p class="heading">
                  How can you tell if youâ€™re a victim of blue light and sleep
                  deprivation?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most obvious tell-tale sign is if you tend to stay awake
                  and toss and turn for hours in bed, resulting in sleepless
                  nights. This leads to a lack of a fixed sleep schedule and you
                  wake up feeling groggy and miserable. Few other signs are
                  blurry vision before falling asleep, dry and irritated eyes,
                  headaches, and worst of all, damaged retinas; this disease is
                  known as phototoxicity.
                </p>
                <p class="heading">How can I reduce it and sleep well?</p>
                <p>
                  Now, all this might sound scary, but there is an easy and
                  efficient way to reduce the effects or cut it out entirely.
                  The age old advice: stop using electronics two hours before
                  bed! Before you shake your head and move on to another
                  article, think about it. What would you rather have? A good
                  nightâ€™s sleep so you can wake up refreshed with a smile on
                  your face to the birds chirping (very cinematic), or checking
                  your social media and waking up feeling sick and tired and
                  wishing you were still asleep?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you absolutely have to use electronics and simply can't
                  live without it, then using blue light blocking glasses and
                  dimming your device might help. Try reducing the time you use
                  it for, if you can't cut it out altogether. Use dim red lights
                  during the night, as red light is less likely to change your
                  circadian rhythm and suppress the hormone melatonin. Perhaps,
                  by calling a friend instead of texting them, or by reading a
                  paperback book instead of watching a youtube video tonight,
                  youâ€™ll wake up feeling a little better tomorrow.

                    Hi! I'm Tiya. I am an 11th grader in Calcutta International
                    School. I love all things Science and medicine, and
                    literature. Honestly, I could stay up for hours on end just
                    reading and researching. I joined Verity Today in hopes to
                    help others develop an interest in STEM and step out of my
                    comfort zone and learn new things.
